# Overview

## Introduction

### What is Rapid SCADA

Rapid SCADA is an open source industrial automation platform. The out of the box software provides tools for rapid creation of monitoring and control systems. In case of large implementation, Rapid SCADA is used as a core for development of custom SCADA and MES solutions for a Customer.

Open source is the key to software transparency and security. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6) . Rapid SCADA is released under [Apache License 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) which permits creation of new derivative software products.

Rapid SCADA is a perfect choice for creating large distributed industrial automation systems. Rapid SCADA runs on servers, embedded computers and in the cloud. Rapid SCADA nodes exchange information between themselves, and interact with external databases in real time.

The main classes of systems developed using Rapid SCADA are the following:

- Industrial automation systems and IIoT systems.
- Process control systems.
- Energy accounting systems.

## Applications

### Server

Server manages the data archives, performs mathematical calculations and provides information to the client applications. Server writes data to the main archive and makes the backup copy simultaneously.

![Figure 1. Graphical shell for Server configuring](applications-files/scada-server-en.png)

Server works as a service. It does not have a user interface. Server operates continuously in the background regardless of user login and logout. The graphical shell for Server configuring is built into the Administrator application (see Figure 1).

The application monitors user connections and checks user rights while processing requests and passing commands. Information about the application state and performed actions is stored in textual log files. Server is designed for non-stop running.

Additional server modules allow extending the functionality of Server according to customer requirements.

### Communicator

Communicator interacts with controllers and transmits data to the Server application. Communication with controllers connected to a system is executed in parallel across multiple lines. Communicator receives current data, archive data, and events from controllers and sends commands to controllers. The application helps troubleshooting issues with communication lines and devices.

![Figure 2. Graphical shell for Communicator configuring](applications-files/scada-comm-en.png)

Communicator works as a service, and does not have a user interface. The graphical shell for Communicator configuring is built into the Administrator application (see Figure 2). Information about the application, communication lines and each connected device is written in log files. Communicator is designed for non-stop running.

Developers are able to implement their own device drivers to interact with a variety of controllers.

### Webstation

Webstation is a web application that displays information to a dispatcher via browser and implements the function of sending commands. Data can be represented in various forms as tables, mimic diagrams, reports, etc. Reports are generated in commonly used Excel, PDF and HTML formats.

![Figure 3. Webstation application. Scheme view](applications-files/scada-web-scheme-en.png)

![Figure 4. Webstation application. Table view](applications-files/scada-web-table-en.png)

User is able to choose a view (table or scheme) and a date to access archive data. To show a trend, click an item icon in a table or an appropriate element in a scheme.

Webstation is available from any computer or tablet connected to an organization network, no software installation is required. Access is managed by a system administrator who defines user rights.

The functionality of Webstation can be extended by additional plugins. For example, [Chart Pro Plugin](../modules/plg-chart-pro.html) extends the capabilities of Rapid SCADA charts: adds scaling, displaying of multiple charts, export to PNG and PDF. [Elastic Report Plugin](../modules/plg-elastic-report.html) allows to generate reports according to a custom configuration. Using this plugin, you can build almost any desired report. Developers can create their own plugins for the web application, displaying information to an operator in any form.

### Agent

Agent transfers configuration between Rapid SCADA instance and the Administrator application. In addition, Agent provides log files for displaying in Administrator. Agent runs as a service on a server where Rapid SCADA instance, controlled by Agent, is installed. An instance of Rapid SCADA includes the Server, Communicator and Webstation applications, all or some of these applications.

Agent communicates with Administrator via TCP. Therefore, Administrator can be installed on the same computer as Agent, or on another computer that is accessible over the network. By default, Agent uses TPC port 10002. In case of remote access, incoming connections on this port must be allowed by the server firewall.

Agent does not have a user interface. To check its operation, log files are used.

### Administrator

The Administrator application (see Figure 5) is intended for developing Rapid SCADA projects and monitoring the state of the automated system. Administrator is an integrated development environment provides editing the configuration database, configuring the main Rapid SCADA applications, Server modules and device drivers.

![Figure 5. Administrator application](applications-files/scada-admin-en.png)

Tools and features of the Administrator application that speed up the configuration process are as follows:

- Wizards for creating communication lines, devices and channels.
- Import and export of the configuration database tables for exchanging works between projects.
- Channel cloning to minimize manual input.
- Searching, sorting and filtering the configuration database tables.

A project contains a set of configuration files, mainly using the XML format. This approach makes it easy to copy projects from one computer to another. To control project versions and collaboration, Git is the best choice.

## Software Architecture

Rapid SCADA software has a multi-tier architecture. Applications (services) included in the software interact with each other using the TCP protocol. Figure 1 shows a commonly used architecture for a simple system that is deployed in the default installation. Figure 2 shows a distributed architecture in which different services are deployed on separate hosts.

![Figure 1. Default architecture](architecture-files/scada-arc-simple-en.png)

![Figure 2. Distributed architecture](architecture-files/scada-arc-complex-en.png)

Rapid SCADA includes the following main applications:

1. *Webstation* is a web application that displays information to a dispatcher via a browser in tabular form, on diagrams and graphs, and also generates reports.
2. *Server* manages the data archives, performs mathematical calculations and provides information to the client applications.
3. *Communicator* collects data from controllers, diagnoses devices, and transmits information to the Server application over the network.

Note that Rapid SCADA supports architecture options in which instances of the Server application exchange data with each other for the purpose of redundancy.

# Installation

## System Requirements

### Server Software Requirements

Windows:

- Operating system: Microsoft Windows Server 2016/2019/2022, Microsoft Windows 10/11.
- .NET Runtime 8.0.
- Microsoft IIS is required to deploy the web application.

Linux:

- Operating system: Ubuntu (recommended), Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Red Hat, and more.
- .NET Runtime 8.0.
- Nginx is required to deploy the web application.

### Server Hardware Requirements

Hardware configuration of a server depends on the scale of the automated system. The minimum configuration is determined by the operating system requirements. The methodology for estimating the required hard disk space is described in the Archives section.

Rapid SCADA uses its own built-in database management system by default, so installing a third-party DBMS is not necessary. The software can run on physical or virtual machines.

### Workstation or Tablet Requirements

- Up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge browser.
- Microsoft Office or LibreOffice is required to view reports.

## Install on Windows

### Preparing to install

Rapid SCADA requires Internet Information Services (IIS) and .NET Runtime to be installed. Depending on the version of Windows, the installation process for those components may vary.

Open **Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off** and enable **Internet Information Services** . The selection of IIS child components can be kept as default.

![](install-windows-files/win10-features-iis-en.png)

Download from the [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) and install ASP.NET Core Runtime 8.0.x (Hosting Bundle) and .NET Desktop Runtime.

![](install-windows-files/dotnet8-download.png)

After the installation of the components is complete, open **Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** , navigate to **Modules** , and make sure that `AspNetCoreModuleV2` is installed. If the module is missing, reinstall Hosting Bundle.

![](install-windows-files/iis-modules-en.png)

### Installation

[Download](https://rapidscada.org/download-all-files/) and unzip the Rapid SCADA distribution package. Run the `ScadaSetup.exe` file to open the installer shown in the figures below. Installation must be performed using an administrator account. Click the **Install** button to enter the installation options.

**Note:** If the installer does not start, then open the properties of `*.dll` , `*.exe` files and unblock the files.

![](install-windows-files/installer-en.png)

![](install-windows-files/installer-apps-en.png)

![](install-windows-files/installer-dir-en.png)

![](install-windows-files/installer-web-en.png)

HTTP port 80 is used by the Default Web Site. Therefore, the installer suggests a different port, such as 10008. To use port 80 for Rapid SCADA, the Default Web Site must be stopped.

After the installation has completed successfully, launch a web browser and open [http://localhost:10008](http://localhost:10008)  Username: *admin*  Password: *scada*

The first time the web application starts, it takes time to load the data, so you may need to wait about 10 seconds and then refresh the login page. By default, Rapid SCADA runs the Hello World project. If errors occur during the installation process, analyze them using the installation log. Use the [support forum](https://forum.rapidscada.org/) to find a solution.

The Rapid SCADA services actively write to log files. To extend the life of the hard drive and increase system performance, it is recommended to configure logging to RAM drive. Action sequence:

1. Install the software for creating RAM drives, for example, [AMD Radeon RAMDisk](http://www.radeonramdisk.com/software_downloads.php) or [Dataram RAMDisk](http://memory.dataram.com/products-and-services/software/ramdisk) .
2. Specify the log directory in `ScadaInstanceConfig.xml` , for example, `R:\SCADA\`
3. Restart the Rapid SCADA services or reboot the computer.

If the web application is not in use, it stops. On a production server, it is preferable that the web application be always up and running. To ensure this, start **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** , select the `ScadaAppPool` application pool, open **Advanced Settings** of the application pool, and set the following options:

- General - Start Mode: *AlwaysRunning*
- Process Model - Idle Time-out: *0*
- Recycling - Regular Time Interval: *0*

### Update

The installer allows to update the previously installed Rapid SCADA version 6.

Important 
            The update feature cannot be used to update Rapid SCADA from version 5 to version 6.
            The update feature does not check the compatibility of the project being executed with the new version of the software.
            The update must first be tested on a test server and only after verification run on a production server.
        

The update is performed according to the following algorithm:

1. Check if the specified installation directory exists.
2. Stop the updated services.
3. Create a backup copy of the updated applications.
4. Update the selected applications. When an application is updated, the existing files are overwritten with the new files. The configuration and storage directories of the application are not affected. Software modules that have been installed additionally remain unchanged.
5. Start the services.

### Uninstallation

Uninstalling Rapid SCADA is also done using the installer. Therefore, it is recommended not to remove the Rapid SCADA distribution from the hard drive after installation.

Rapid SCADA projects created by users are located by default inside the **Documents** folder. Therefore, after the removal of Rapid SCADA, the projects will remain. It is strongly not recommended to save projects inside the installation directory, because they may be accidentally deleted by the installer.

## Install on Windows Manually

Manual Rapid SCADA setup provides full control over the process of the software installation, update and uninstallation.

### Installation

1. Install Internet Information Services (IIS) by selecting the corresponding Windows components.
2. Install ASP.NET Core Runtime 8.0.x (Hosting Bundle) and .NET Desktop Runtime from this link. Note: If the web application is not needed on Windows, skip the item 1 and install only .NET Desktop Runtime.
3. Copy the application files to the Rapid SCADA installation directory `C:\Program Files\SCADA`
4. Register the services by executing the following files as administrator:  `ScadaAgent\svc_install.bat`  `ScadaComm\svc_install.bat`  `ScadaServer\svc_install.bat`
5. Register the web application:

                Open the module list and make sure the AspNetCoreModuleV2 module is present.
                Create an application pool named ScadaAppPool, set .NET CLR version to No Managed Code.
                Open the advanced settings of the created application pool, and set the Identity parameter to LocalSystem.
                Add a new web site named ScadaWeb, specify the created application pool, available TCP port and the pathC:\Program Files\SCADA\ScadaWeb
             Note: HTTP port 80 is used by Default Web Site. Use another port, such as 10008, or stop Default Web Site.
6. Create a RAM drive for writing logs: 
                Install the software for creating RAM drives, for example, AMD Radeon RAMDisk or Dataram RAMDisk.
                Specify the log directory in ScadaInstanceConfig.xml, for example, R:\SCADA\
            
7. Create a shortcut to the Administrator application ( `ScadaAdmin.exe` ) on the desktop.
8. Restart the computer to start services automatically.
9. After restart, open http://localhost:PORT or http://SERVER_IP:PORT in a web browser.  Username: *admin*  Password: *scada*

### Uninstallation

1. Stop and unregister the services by executing the following files as administrator:  `ScadaAgent\svc_stop.bat`  `ScadaAgent\svc_uninstall.bat`  `ScadaComm\svc_stop.bat`  `ScadaComm\svc_uninstall.bat`  `ScadaServer\svc_stop.bat`  `ScadaServer\svc_uninstall.bat`
2. Disable a RAM drive.
3. Open IIS Manager and remove the previously created web application and application pool.
4. Delete the Rapid SCADA installation directory with all contents.
5. Remove the Administrator application shortcut from the desktop.

## Service Management

The Server, Communicator and Agent applications run as services. On Linux, the Webstation application also runs as a separate service. To manage Rapid SCADA services, use the Administrator application or operating system tools.

Services are managed by the Administrator application using the Instance Status form, which is opened by the  button located on the application toolbar.

![](services-files/instance-status-en.png)

The following table contains the names of the Windows services and Linux daemons that are included in Rapid SCADA.

| Application | Windows Serice | Linux Daemon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server | ScadaServer6 | scadaserver6 |
| Communicator | ScadaComm6 | scadacomm6 |
| Webstation | - | scadaweb6 |
| Agent | ScadaAgent6 | scadaagent6 |

On Windows, the `services.msc` snap-in is available to manage services. The startup type of the Server, Communicator and Agent services is set to Automatic by default, so the services start when the operating system starts and stop when it shuts down. If autostart is not required, set the Manual startup type in the properties of the corresponding services.

![](services-files/services-en.png)

Commands to start daemons on Linux:

```sh
sudo systemctl start scadaagent6
sudo systemctl start scadaserver6
sudo systemctl start scadacomm6
sudo systemctl start scadaweb6
```



Commands to stop daemons on Linux:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop scadaweb6
sudo systemctl stop scadacomm6
sudo systemctl stop scadaserver6
sudo systemctl stop scadaagent6
```



## Transfer to New Server

This article describes how to migrate a running Rapid SCADA instance from one server to another. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Check that connections with polled devices are configured on the new server: 
            there are serial ports whose numbers match the port numbers on the old server,
            controllers polled over the network are available,
            OPC servers installed and configured.
        
2. Install Rapid SCADA on the new server and check its functionality with the default configuration.
3. Stop the Server and Communicator services on the new server.
4. Stop the Server and Communicator services on the obsolete server and disable automatic startup of these services.
5. Copy data archives from the obsolete server to the new one. The method for copying archives depends on whether the archives are file-based or DBMS-based.
6. Open the project in the Administrator application and upload the configuration to the new server with the  button.
7. If additional modules are used, obtain and enter registration keys for the new server, then re-upload the project for execution.
8. Check whether the new server operates well.

If the new server does not work on the first try, stop the Server and Communicator services on it and start these services on the obsolete server. Information that will help resolve technical issues is contained in the application and module operation logs.

## Safety Recommendations

### File Protection

If Rapid SCADA is used in a corporate environment, ensure that other users do not have access to the Rapid SCADA installation directory . On Windows, open the properties of the directory containing  Rapid SCADA applications, choose the **Security** tab, check and and configure access rights.

### HTTPS

Configure a web server to enable HTTPS protocol for the Webstation application. Using HTTPS, all traffic between a browser and the web server, including passwords, is encrypted.

### VPN

Use VPN to provide access for external users. If possible, avoid open access to Webstation from outside.

### Passwords

Change the default passwords. To create strong passwords, use a password generator, for example, available [here](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) . If a company uses Active Directory, setting up Rapid SCADA user authentication based on Active Directory enhances system security.

Passwords to be set:

- User passwords in the **Users** table of the project.
- Password for connecting to the Server application in the Communicator and Webstation settings.
- Agent password, located in the `ScadaAgentConfig.xml` file.
- Password for connecting to the Agent application in the deployment profile.

**Note** : The user table stores password hashes. A password cannot be recovered from a hash code. XML configuration files contain encrypted passwords that are decrypted by applications during execution.

# Configuration

## Configuration Basics

### Creating Project

Configuration of Rapid SCADA is performed on a project basys. A project is a set of files in various formats that are stored in the project directory. To create and edit projects, use the Administrator application. When Administrator starts, the **Start Page** opens, which contains the buttons to create a new or open an existing project (see Figure 1).

![Figure 1. Start page](configuration-basics-files/start-page-en.png)

![Figure 2. Project creation form](configuration-basics-files/new-project-en.png)

Pay attention to the **Template** field on the project creation form (see Figure 2). The template defines the initial configuration that is added to the project. Another existing project can be used as a template.

### Project Structure

The structure of the Rapid SCADA project is displayed in the project explorer, which is located on the left side of the main Administrator window. The project consists of the following main parts (see Figure 3):

- The **Configuration Database** consists of tables. It is a general structured description of the automated system. The detailed settings refer to the corresponding applications.
- The **Views** section contains view files that are displayed by the Webstation application, and report configuration files. Views examples are mimic diagrams, tables, maps and dashboards.
- Server application settings.
- Communicator application settings.
- Webstation web application settings.

![Figure 3. Project structure](configuration-basics-files/project-structure-en.png)

An **instance** is a set of Rapid SCADA applications running the same project and installed on the same computer.

A single project can include multiple instances that exchange data. The Administrator application can connect to remote servers, so configuration and control of Rapid SCADA can be carried out by an engineer using one workstation.

### Configuration Sequence

Starting to work with Rapid SCADA, it is recommended to follow the general configuration sequence described below. Having obtained some experience, better understanding the dependencies between the applications, the sequence can be varied to increase efficiency.

1. Create a new or open an existing project in the Administrator application.
2. Add objects, communications lines and devices into the configuration database. To create communication lines and devices it is recommended to use wizards that are opened using the  and  buttons located on the Administrator's toolbar.
3. Check that the added communication lines and devices are present in the Communicator settings. If necessary, create them by selecting the **Synchronize** menu item from the context menu of the **Communication Lines** node in the project explorer.
4. Configure [device polling](device-polling.html) in Communicator.
5. Create [channels](channels.html) in the configuration database. It is recommended to use the wizard opened by the  button.
6. Create [views](views.html) and specify them in the **Views** table of the configuration database.
7. Upload the project for execution by the  button.

## Configuration Database

### Database Model

The configuration database is a part of the project, consisting of tables and common to all project instances. The applications included in Rapid SCADA use the information from the configuration database in conjunction with their settings.

The configuration database is edited using the Administrator application. The edited copy of the configuration database is in XML file format. When a project is uploaded to a server for execution, the configuration database is converted into a special DAT format.

The configuration database consists of tables, which in turn are composed of columns and rows. Each table belongs to one of the following groups:

1. Primary tables. This group contains the tables that define the operating of a particular project.
2. Secondary tables. During the development of the project, minor additions are made to the tables in this group.

The following is a list of configuration database tables with a brief description.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Tables** |
| Objects | Contains logical objects that are used to structure information in the system and manage access rights. Objects can be hierarchical |
| Communication lines | Describes communication lines that group devices and determine the polling order |
| Devices | Contains a list of physical or virtual devices |
| Channels | Channels are necessary for storing measured data, mathematical calculations and sending commands |
| Limits | Contains a list of limits for channel values |
| Views | Contains view attributes and specifies the structure of the view tree |
| Roles | Contains a list of user roles. A role is a set of access rights. Do not change or delete the built-in roles |
| Role inheritance | Allows to configure a parent role based on the rights of child roles |
| Object rights | Defines rights of custom roles on objects |
| Users | Contains a list of users with their roles. The Password column stores password hashes |
| **Secondary Tables** |
| Archive kinds | Dictionary of archive kinds |
| Archives | Dictionary of archives. The archives in the table correspond to the archives in the Server settings |
| Channel statuses | Dictionary of channel statuses. Among other things, it sets the match between a channel status and some event parameters |
| Channel types | Dictionary of channel types |
| Data types | Dictionary of data types |
| Device types | Dictionary of device types (drivers) |
| Formats | Dictionary of formats used when displaying channel and command values |
| Quantities | Dictionary of quantities |
| Scripts | Dictionary of scripts and formulas used in calculating channel and command values |
| Units | Dictionary of units |
| View types | Dictionary of view types |

### Editing Database

The configuration database tables are related to each other, that is, a cell of one table can refer to a record of another table. For example, a device refers to a communication line to which it is connected. Therefore, it is efficient to edit tables in a certain sequence. For tables from the **Primary tables** group, enter data in order starting with the **Objects** table and ending by the **Users** table.

The Administrator application provides tools that make editing the configuration database faster and handy:

- The search and replace dialog is called by the  button, which is located on the application toolbar, or by the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + F .
- Filtering a table hides unnecessary rows. If the table is filtered, search and replace is performed only on the table rows that are displayed. The filter window is called by the  button.
- When editing table cells, use the functions cut Ctrl + X , copy Ctrl + C and paste Ctrl + V . That functions can also be applied for cells whose values ​​are selected from a drop-down list.
- Clicking a column header sorts the rows in the table by the values in that column.
- If the properties button is displayed on the table toolbar, then the rows for that table can be edited using a dialog form.
- The wizards, which are called up with the  ,  and  buttons located on the main toolbar, help to quickly fill out the **Communication lines** , **Devices** and **Channels** tables.
- The channel cloning tool is useful for populating the **Channels** table if the system contains many similar devices. The tool is available through the main menu **Tools > Project Tools > Clone Channels** .
- Using the table import and export functions, you can transfer previously completed work between projects. XML, CSV and DAT data formats are supported. The functions are available in the main menu section **Tools > Project Tools** .
- The integrity check tool helps ensure that the relations between the tables are valid and that table foreign keys point to existing records.

## Device Polling

Interaction with devices is performed by the Communicator application, which requests data and sends commands to devices, acting as a master or slave. The polled devices are controllers, input/output modules, metering devices, as well as external data sources, which are also conventionally called devices. All devices belong to communication lines that are independent and operate in parallel.

Devices are polled using various communication protocols, such as Modbus, OPC or MQTT. Each protocol is implemented by a corresponding driver. Some drivers are installed by default during the Rapid SCADA installation process. Other drivers can be installed additionally.

### Communication Line Options

Figure 1 shows an example of setting up the main options of a communication line. Pay attention to the communication channel settings. A communication channel defines a physical interface or network protocol used to poll devices. The following communication channels are supported: Serial port, TCP client, TCP server, UDP and MQTT client. In some cases, if device connection is implemented directly by a driver (for example, OPC), the communication channel should be left unspecified.

![Figure 1. Main line options](device-polling-files/line-options-en.png)

Custom line options are specific to the driver being used. They are configured using a user interface implemented by the driver, or can be set according to instructions for a certain device type.

### Device Options

In the **Device Polling** section, individual polling options are configured for each device related to the communication line.

![Figure 2. Device polling options](device-polling-files/device-options-en.png)

The table below clarifies the device polling options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | Indicates that the device is being polled |
| Poll only on command | To poll the device, send a command |
| Bound to the configuration database | If the option is set, the device tags are bound to the channels of the configuration database, and the received data is sent to the Server application |
| Number | Device number. It must match the device number in the configuration database |
| Name | Device name |
| Driver | A driver that implements the communication protocol supported by the device |
| Numeric address | Device address as a number |
| String address or host name | Device address as a string. This is usually an IP address |
| Timeout | Duration of waiting for a response from the device in milliseconds |
| Delay | Delay after receiving data in milliseconds |
| Time and Period | If both options are zero, the device is polled continuously and cyclically. If the time is specified and the period is zero, the device is polled once a day at the specified time. If the period is greater than zero, the device is polled periodically, starting at the specified time |
| Command line | Additional options determined by the driver and described in its instructions |
| Options | Similar to command line, but more structured |

If the device requires device type-specific options, click the **Properties** button to then to configure them in a dialog window provided by the driver. The **Reset** button restores the device polling options to the default values determined by the selected driver.

### Synchronizing Settings

The synchronization feature helps create communication lines and devices in the Communicator settings based on data from the **Communication lines** and **Devices** tables of the configuration database. And vice versa, fill the configuration database tables based on the Communicator settings. To open the synchronization dialog, in the project explorer, right-click the **Communication Lines** node or the node of a specific line, then select **Synchronize** from the context menu.

![Figure 3. Synchronize line and devices](device-polling-files/line-device-sync-en.png)

## Channels

A **channel** is an entity that has a number and name, with which current and historical data, as well as events, are associated. Synonyms in other systems: variable and tag.

### Channel Properties

A channel can be edited directly in the **Channels** table, as well as using the channel properties form. To open the properties form, select a channel in the table and click the  button or double-click a table row. Below are screenshots of the channel properties form and under each image the specifics of setting the corresponding properties are described.

![Figure 1. General channel properties](channels-files/channel-general-en.png)

If uncheck the **Active** checkbox, the channel will be excluded from processing. The **Code** field is intended for integration with third-party systems and does not affect the operation of Rapid SCADA applications. If **Data type** is not specified, then the *Double* type is used. If **Data length** is specified and its value is greater than 1, then the Server application creates several channels with sequential numbers. The **Channel types** are described in the table of the same name. The **Tag Code** string field is intended for linking the channel and device tag in Communicator. The **Tag number** numeric field works similarly, but is deprecated. The use of formulas is described in the next [article](scripts.html) .

![Figure 2. Channel display properties](channels-files/channel-display-en.png)

The **Format** field determines the display of channel values ​​in the user interface, but does not affect saving data to the archive. Specify a **Command format** if the values ​​in the command sending window should be formatted differently than when viewed.

![Figure 3. Channel limits](channels-files/channel-limits-en.png)

A limit record can be used by one or more channels. In the second case, the limit is marked as **shared** . If the **Bound to channels** option is enabled when creating a limit, then the actual values ​​of the limit are the values ​​of the channels whose numbers were specified when creating it.

![Figure 4. Channel properties. Archives](channels-files/channel-archives-en.png)

It is possible for a channel to specify in which archives its data is stored. If archives are not selected, that is, the archive mask is empty or equal to 0, then the channel data is stored in the default archives.

![Figure 5. Channel properties. Events](channels-files/channel-events-en.png)

On the **Events** page, set the criteria by which events related to the channel should be recorded in the event archive.

### Tools

To create channels, there is a wizard (see Figures 6-8), which is called by the  button located on the Administrator application toolbar. However, automatic creation of channels must be supported by the driver of the device for which the channels are created, otherwise the channels are created manually. The channel creation wizard starts *after* device polling is configured in the Communicator application.

![Figure 6. Channel creation wizard. Step 1](channels-files/create-channels-step1-en.png)

![Figure 7. Channel creation wizard. Step 2](channels-files/create-channels-step2-en.png)

![Figure 8. Channel creation wizard. Step 3](channels-files/create-channels-step3-en.png)

The cloning tool (see Figure 9) allows to quickly create similar channels based on existing ones. On the cloning form, specify the source and destination channel numbers. You can also select a new object and device for the cloned channels. The feature of updating channel numbers in formulas works if the channel number is used as an argument in the following functions: N(), Val(), Stat(), SetVal(), SetStat() and SetData().

![Figure 9. Cloning channels](channels-files/clone-channels-en.png)

Tools for importing and exporting configuration database tables (see Figures 10 and 11) make it easier to use previously made work from other projects. DAT, XML and CSV table formats are supported. To limit the range of data that is imported and exported, specify the start and end IDs.

![Figure 10. Import table](channels-files/import-table-en.png)

![Figure 11. Export table](channels-files/export-table-en.png)

The cloning, import and export tools are accessed through the **Tools > Project Tools** menu of the Administrator application.

## Scripts and Formulas

The Server application has a built-in engine for executing user scripts. Scripts are used to calculate channel values and statuses, as well as to calculate command values.

Scripts are written to the **Scripts** table of the configuration database. A project created using a template already contains an initial set of scripts, which can be used as examples for developing your own scripts. Variables and functions implemented in the **Scripts** table are then called in the **Input Formula** and **Output Formula** columns of the **Channels** table. To perform formula calculations for a channel, select the checkbox in the **Formula Enabled** column.

### Script Creation Rules

General rules for writing and using scripts:

1. Scripts are written according to the [syntax of C# language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/) . Various .NET framework classes are available, such as Math, DateTime, and File.
2. New constants, fields, properties, and methods are added to the Scripts table and become available in channel formulas.
3. If at least one script or formula contains an error, Server operation is impossible. Information about errors in scripts is written in the Server application log.

Rules for calculating channel formulas:

1. An input formula for channels of the *Input* and *Input/Output* types is calculated only when Server receives new data for that channels. Use the mentioned types of channels if the data comes from devices.
2. An input formula for channels of the *Calculated* and *Calculated/Output* types is calculated continuously at each iteration of the main Server loop. The calculation sequence is from smaller to larger channel numbers. Calculated channel types are used if the value and status of a channel are calculated based on data of other channels.
3. An output formula for channels of the *Input/Output* , *Calculated/Output* and *Output* types is calculated when a command is sent to the corresponding channel.
4. A channel status after calculating an input formula for channels of the *Input* and *Input/Output* types is equal to the status of the data transferred to Server, if the status calculation is not explicitly specified in the formula.
5. For channels of the *Calculated* and *Calculated/Output* types, the status is set to *Defined* if the status calculation is not explicitly specified in the formula.
6. If an input formula contains the ";" symbol, it is split into two parts: the first part calculates the channel value, and the second part calculates the channel status.
7. If a channel has specified limits, the channel status is recalculated taking the limits into account after calculating the channel's input formula.
8. Formulas must return values of certain data types, described below.

Channel input formulas return data of the following types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| double | Channel value |
| CnlData | Channel value and status |
| long | 64-bit integer value of a channel whose data type is set to *Integer* in the **Channels** table |
| string | String value of a channel whose data type is set to *ASCII string* or *Unicode string* in the **Channels** table |

If a channel's input formula returns a data type other than those listed in the table above, the value returned by the formula is cast to the appropriate type based on the data type of the channel. The part of the channel input formula that calculates the channel status must return an integer value of type `int` .

Channel output formulas return data of the following types:

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| double | Command value. To cancel a command, formula must return `double.NaN` |
| CnlData | Command value. To cancel a command, formula must return `CnlData.Empty` |
| byte[] | Binary command data. To cancel a command, formula must return `null` |
| string | String command data. Converted by Server into a byte array |

### Available Variables

The scripting engine provides the following built-in variables:

| Variable | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timestamp | DateTime | Timestamp of the processed data (UTC) |
| IsCurrent | bool | Processed data is current data |
| CnlNum | int | Channel number for which the formula is calculated |
| Channel | Cnl | Properties of the channel for which the formula is calculated |
| ArrIdx | int | Index of the processed array element |
| Cnl, CnlVal | double | Channel value transmitted to Server before the calculation |
| CnlStat | int | Channel status transmitted to Server before the calculation |
| CnlData | CnlData | Channel data transmitted to Server before the calculation |
| Cmd, CmdVal | double | Command value transmitted to Server before the calculation |
| CmdData | byte[] | Command data transmitted to Server |
| CmdDataStr | string | Command data as a string |

### Available Functions

The scripting engine provides the following built-in functions:

| PrevTime() | DateTime | Previous timestamp of the formula channel |
| PrevTime(n) | DateTime | Previous timestamp of the channel n |
| Deriv(n) | double | Time derivative of the channel n |

### Functions from Project Template

In a project that was created based on a standard template, the **Scripts** table contains the following functions:

| Function | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetBit(val, n) | double | Returns the n-th bit of the specified value |
| GetBit(cnlData, n) | CnlData | Returns a channel data consists of the n-th bit of the value and the channel status |

Additional scripts, including those for calculating averages, are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-community/tree/master/Formulas) .

### Debugging Scripts

When developing your own scripts, follow the syntax rules and check that the scripts work correctly. If the Server service failed to compile scripts at startup, error information is displayed in the Server operation log `ScadaServer.log` , and the compiled source code is available in the `CalcEngine.cs` file, which is located in the Server log directory. To develop complex formulas, we recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Examples of Formulas

Example 1: Linear transformation of a channel value received from a device. The formula is used for a channel of the *Input* type.

```
10 * Cnl + 1
```



Example 2: The sum of the values of channels 101 and 102. The status is extracted from channel 101. The formula is used for a channel of the *Calculated* type.

```
Val(101) + Val(102); Stat(101)
```



Example 3: The formula that is used for a channel of calculation type extracts the 0 th bit from the data of channel 105.

```
GetBit(Data(105), 0)
```



Example 4: The formula increments the counter by one every minute, resetting the counter at the beginning of each hour.

```
EveryMin(() => HourStarted() ? 0 : Val() + 1)
```



## Views

**View** is a form of data representation in the Webstation application. There are 3 types of views supported by default: table views, mimic diagrams and web pages. Support for other types of views can be added by installing additional plugins. A complete list of implemented view types is contained in the **View types** table of the configration database.

### Creating Views

View files are located in the **Views** section of a project. To create a file or folder in the views section, right-click on the explorer node in this section, then select **New File** or **New Folder** from the context menu that appears (see Figure 1).

![Figure 1. View context menu](views-files/view-menu-en.png)

When creating a file, select a view type in the dialog box, specify a file name and click **OK** (see Figure 2). The created file will appear in the project explorer. Double-clicking opens the view in an editor corresponding to the file extension.

![Figure 2. View creation dialog](views-files/new-file-en.png)

There are specialized editor applications for table views and mimic diagrams. Other types of view files are in XML format and can be edited using general-purpose text editors.

### View Table

After a view file is created, it must be registered in the configuration database in the **Views** table, as shown in Figure 3. Subfolders in which the view files are located must also be listed in the table in order to assign access rights to them.

![Figure 3. Views table](views-files/view-table-en.png)

**Path** to a view is relative to the views directory. Regardless of the operating system used on the server, the path separator is a backslash. Some views, such as **Web page** views, do not have a view file. For such views, specify a path that determines the location of the view in the view explorer of the Webstation application.

**View Type** is selected from a drop-down list. If a view file has an extension registered in the View types table, then view type does not need to be specified because it will be determined automatically.

An **Object** whose data is displayed by the view must be specified to configure access rights.

The **Arguments** column contains additional view parameters that that the behavior of the view. For views of the **Web page** type, a page address is specified as arguments.

A **Title** specified for a view is displayed in the view tree. If the title is blank, the file name is used as the title.

The **Order** numeric field determines the order in which views are processed when generating the view explorer. If no order is specified, views are processed in the order of their IDs.

The **Hide** checkbox allows to hide a view from the view explorer. This is useful for auxiliary views that are opened by a link from other views.

![Figure 4. View explorer](views-files/explorer-en.png)

Based on the view table under consideration, the view explorer is populated, which is shown in Figure 4.

## Table Views

A table view (see Figure 1) is designed to display historical data for a day with a specified period, as well as current data. Clicking a table item opens a chart of the channel associated with the item. The  button brings up a dialog for sending a command.

![Figure 1. Table view](table-views-files/table-view-en.png)

### Creating and Editing

One of the advantages of table views is that they are easy to create. Navigate to the **Views** section of a project, right-click on the desired folder and select **New File** from the context menu. In the dialog box that opens (see Figure 2), select the **Table View** type, specify a file name and click **OK** . The created file will appear in the project explorer. Double-clicking opens the view in Table Editor (see Figure 3).

![Figure 2. View creation dialog](table-views-files/new-table-en.png)

![Figure 3. Table editor](table-views-files/table-editor-en.png)

The left panel of the editor contains a list of channels grouped by devices. The main part of the window displays the contents of the table view. Each view item is associated with a device or channel. To add an item to the view, select the corresponding tree node in the left pane, then click the  button, press Enter , or double-click the tree node. The  button adds an empty line. If the configuration database has changed, click the  button located on the application toolbar to refresh devices and channels.

If the **Auto Text** checkbox is checked for a view item, the device or channel name is automatically used as the item's text. If this name is later changed in the configuration database table, there is no need to update the view.

The **Hide** checkbox removes an item from the displayed table. However, the channel numbers corresponding to the hidden element continue to be used by the event filter by view.

After creating a table view, it must be registered in the configuration database in the **Views** table, as described in the previous [article](views.html#view-table) .

### View Options

A window containing the table view options (see Figure 4) is called by the  button located on the editor toolbar. The options are set for the certain view being edited.

![Figure 4. Table view options](table-views-files/table-options-en.png)

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archive code | Specifies the archive from which historical data is retrieved |
| Table period | Time step used to generate the table view columns |
| Chart arguments | Arguments separated by `&` that are added to the address bar when a chart opens |

Example of arguments for the standard Chart plugin: `archive=Min&gap=90` , where `archive` is the archive code, `gap` is the distance between points connected by a line (in seconds).

Example of arguments for [Chart Pro Plugin](../modules/plg-chart-pro.html) : `profile=PlgChartPro.xml` , where `profile` is the name of the chart profile file.

If the **Use default options** checkbox is checked, the archive code and period are loaded from the web application configuration file `ScadaWebConfig.xml` . The `TableArchiveCode` and `TablePeriod` options located in the `Main` group of the `CustomOptions` section are used.

## User Management

### Creating Users

Creating, editing and deleting users is performed in the Administrator application in the Users table (see Figure 1).

![Figure 1. Users table](user-management-files/users-table-en.png)

Users with IDs from 1 to 12 are created by default from the project template. The *ScadaWeb* and *ScadaComm* users are intended to connect the Webstation and Communicator client applications to the Server application. The *admin* and *guest* users who use the [built-in roles](user-management.html#built-in-roles) are intended to log in to the system. The *alex* , *john* and *maria* users who use [custom roles](user-management.html#custom-roles) are created as an example.

### Rights Assignment

Rights are assigned to roles on objects. Note that rights are assigned only for custom roles. For built-in roles, permission check is already implemented in applications. A **role** is a named set of rights.

Before assigning rights, fill in the **Objects** and **Roles** tables (see Figures 2 and 3). Next, specify the rights in the **Object rights** table (see Figure 4). Objects can relate to each other hierarchically (see Figure 5). If a top-level object has certain permissions, they are inherited by lower-level objects.

![Figure 2. Objects table](user-management-files/objects-table-en.png)

![Figure 3. Roles table](user-management-files/roles-table-en.png)

![Figure 4. Object rights table](user-management-files/object-rights-table-en.png)

![Figure 5. Object hierarchy](user-management-files/object-tree-en.png)

### Built-in Roles

Built-in roles whose permissions are hard-coded into the applications are listed in the following table.

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Disabled | Access denied |
| 1 | Administrator | Full access |
| 2 | Dispatcher | Can view information and send commands |
| 3 | Guest | Can view information |
| 4 | Application | Interacts with the server |

Features of the built-in roles:

- Their IDs are from 0 to 4.
- They apply to all objects.
- Cannot be changed.

### Custom Roles

Custom roles are roles created by the project developer. In the example above, the custom roles are *My role 1* , *My role 2* , and *My role 3* .

It is recommended to assign IDs to custom roles starting from 101. The **Code** field of a role is intended for integration with third-party systems and databases. If integration is not used, the code can be left blank.

By using the role inheritance mechanism, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of records that are added to the **Object rights** table.

In the **Role inheritance** table shown in Figure 6, the child role *My role 3* inherits from the parent roles *My role 1* and *My role 2* the sum of the rights of both.

![Figure 6. Role inheritance](user-management-files/role-inheritance-table-en.png)

To check whether the rights are configured properly, open the **Rights Matrix** window (see Figure 7), which is called by the  button located on the toolbar of the Administrator application. The figure below shows how role inheritance works.

![Figure 7. Right matrix](user-management-files/right-matrix-en.png)

# Modules

## Chart Pro Plugin

### Overview

Chart Pro Plugin is the additional plugin for the Webstation application extends the capabilities of Rapid SCADA charts: adds scaling, displaying of multiple charts, export to PNG and PDF. Download the plugin using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/PlgChartPro) . The appearance of Chart Pro Plugin is shown in the following figure.

![](plg-chart-pro-files/chart-pro-en.png)

### Installation

Chart Pro Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . Follow additional steps during installation:

- Copy the PlgChartPro.xml and PlgChartPro_Config.xml files into your project. The PlgChartPro_Reg.xml file will be created when the registration key is saved. 
                
            
- In the Webstation application options, in the Plugin Assignment section, select the PlgChartPro plugin. 
                
            

### Configuring

Chart Pro Plugin is configured by default. Plugin settings are saved in the `PlgChartPro.xml` and `PlgChartPro_Config.xml` files, which can be edited manually if necessary.

The `PlgChartPro_Config.xml` file contains a list of profiles. A profile is a set of plugin settings that can be selected by a user on the chart web page. The `PlgChartPro.xml` file contains a chart profile, which includes display options and data options.

To create a new profile, copy the `PlgChartPro.xml` file with a new name and edit it. Then specify the created profile in the `PlgChartPro_Config.xml` file.

In addition to the configuration files, the chart display is determined by a query string, which parameters are given in the table below. The query string has the following form: `http://localhost:10008/ChartPro/ChartPro?cnlNums=101-103&startDate=2023-09-16&mode=fixed&period=2&periodMin=60&title=Demo&profile=PlgChartPro.xml`

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cnlNums | Range of integers separated by hyphens and commas | Channel numbers displayed on the chart |
| startDate | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format | Start date of the displayed data. If not specified, the current date is used |
| mode | fixed | rolling | Chart mode: fixed or rolling. If not specified, fixed mode is used |
| period | Integer | Chart period in days relative to the start date. Can be either positive or negative. Used in fixed mode |
| periodMin | Integer | Chart period in minutes in rolling mode |
| title | String | Chart title. If not specified, it is generated automatically |
| profile | String | Chart profile file name. If not specified, the first profile from the list is used |

In the fixed mode, the plugin displays a chart for a selected period of time. The chart data is automatically updated by adding new values to the right side of the chart.

In the rolling mode, the plugin displays a graph from the current moment to the specified depth. The chart data is automatically updated, while the chart shifts from right to left.

The following figure helps to understand the layout of the chart in order to change the plugin configuration.

![](plg-chart-pro-files/chart-parts.svg)

#### View Mode

Chart Pro Plugin supports the view mode, in which a chart node is added to the view tree of Webstation. To display the chart as a view, add the following row to the Views table:

![](plg-chart-pro-files/chart-pro-view-en.png)

The Path field contains the path in the view tree. The View Type field should be set to Chart Pro. The view arguments correspond to the query string parameters described above.

## Dashboard Plugin

### Overview

Dashboard Plugin displays useful widgets on dashboards: charts, current data and arbitrary frames, for example, CCTV camera stream. Settings of each dashboard allow to specify column count and widget aspect ratio. Download the plugin using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/PlgDashboard) . The appearance of Dashboard Plugin is shown in the following figure.

![](plg-dashboard-files/dashboard-en.png)

### Installation

Dashboard Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . No unusual actions are required during installation.

### Configuring

#### Adding Dashboards

Configuration of each dashboard is stored in a separate XML file. The dashboard example, `Dashboard1.xml` , is included in the plugin installation package. Dashboard files should be located in the views directory.

In order to display dashboard nodes in the explorer tree of Webstation, perform the following settings in the project:

1. Create and edit a dashboard file in the views directory.
2. Specify the dashboard path in the **Views** table of the configuration database.

![](plg-dashboard-files/dashboard-view-file-en.png)

![](plg-dashboard-files/dashboard-view-table-en.png)

It is required to explicitly specify the view type because the Webstation application cannot automatically determine the type based on the xml file extension.

#### Dashboard File Structure

A dashboard consists of widgets. The layout of widgets on the dashboard is controlled by the [Bootstrap grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) . Widgets are arranged in rows, each of which can contain up to 12 widgets. For a widget, you can set the width from 1 to 12, so that the total width of the widgets in the row is equal to 12. If the widget width is not specified, it is calculated automatically. The breakpoint specifies the web page width, which determines how the widgets are positioned. If the page is wider than the breakpoint, the widgets are displayed in a row; otherwise, the widgets are displayed one below the other.

Consider the contents of a dashboard configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<DashboardView>
  <DashboardOptions>
    <!-- Widget AspectRatio = Width / Height -->
    <AspectRatio>1.33</AspectRatio>
    <!-- Breakpoint: ExtraSmall | Small | Medium | Large | ExtraLarge | ExtraExtraLarge -->
    <Breakpoint>Small</Breakpoint>
  </DashboardOptions>
  <Widgets>
    <!-- The total width of the columns in a line is 12 -->
    <Row>
      <Widget type="Chart" columnWidth="5" cnlNums="101,102" />
      <Widget type="Chart" columnWidth="4" cnlNums="101,103" mode="fixed" period="-2" title="Sample Chart" profile="PlgChartPro.xml" />
      <Widget type="CurData" columnWidth="3" cnlNums="101-105" title="Sample Data" />
    </Row>
    <Row columnCount="2">
      <Widget type="View" viewID="2" />
      <Widget type="CustomUrl" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAieE-QtOeM" />
    </Row>
  </Widgets>
</DashboardView>
```



The `DashboardOptions` section contains common dashboard parameters:  `AspectRatio` - ratio of widget width to its height,  `Breakpoint` determines the web page width to switch widget layout.

The `Widgets` section contains a list of widgets that are displayed on a dashboard. The dashboard can contain an arbitrary number of widgets, but no more than 12 in one row. Please note that too many widgets on one dashboard can slow down the performance of the web application.

The attribute of the `Row` element:  `columnCount` - number of columns to display widgets of a given row. If the `columnCount` attribute is specified for the row, then the `columnWidth` attribute is not required for widgets in that row.

The main attributes of the `Widget` element:  `type` - widget type,  `columnWidth` - widget width from 1 to 12,  `cnlNums` - channel numbers.

Widgets of the following types are supported:  `Chart` - a chart of the specified channels,  `CurData` - a table contains current data of the specified channels,  `View` - a view having the specified ID,  `CustomUrl` - custom web page.

Widgets of the `Chart` type support attributes that match the query string parameters described in the [Chart Pro Plugin](plg-chart-pro.html#configuring) documentation. When events are filtered by view, the filter uses the channel numbers specified in the `cnlNums` attributes of the widgets.

## Elastic Report Plugin

### Overview

Elastic Report Plugin allows to generate reports according to a custom configuration. Using this plugin, you can build almost any desired report. A user simply selects the period and clicks the generate report button. Report configurations are created by an administrator. Download the plugin using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/PlgElasticReport) .

### Installation

Elastic Report Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . During installation, complete the following additional step: copy the `PlgElasticReport.xml` file from the plugin distribution into your project. The file should be displayed in the project explorer under the **Webstation > Configuration Files** node.

### Configuring

A report consists of a set of sections, which are listed in the output document, one by one. Each section has its own type, parameters, and data binding. In addition, the report has the general parameters that affect all sections. The same report can be generated in a variety of formats. Currently supported PDF, Excel and HTML formats. The appearance of the same report, generated in different formats may slightly differ.

#### Report Form

Each report form requires the creation of a separate configuration file in XML format. The configuration file specifies the report formatting and determines the binding of report data to channels. This file should be saved in the views directory or a subdirectory within the project.

![](plg-elastic-report/report-file-en.png)

Configuration files may be edited using any text editor. For example, the free editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is convenient for working with XML files.

An example report file `ElasticReport1.xml` is contained in the plugin installation package. This example includes a detailed description of the options and demonstrates the generation of report sections of all possible types.

The main elements of the report configuration file:

- The `InputOptions` element contains options for the input report form, with which a user enters the report parameters and starts generating the document.
- The `OutputOptions` element contains formatting options for the generated document.
- The `Document` element defines the content of the report. 
                The DocumentOptions element specifies basic options that apply to the entire document.
                The Section element describes a report section containing data. A report includes one or more sections of various types.
            

The supported section types:

- The `TimeData` section displays channel data for the selected time period. Channels are displayed horizontally, timestamps are displayed vertically.
- The `TimeTime` section displays data of one channel in a compact form. Timestamps are displayed in the horizontal and vertical section headers.
- The `DataData` section displays data in a table form. Each cell can be linked to its own channel.

The plugin provides the generation of reports based on historical data. Reports on current data and events are not supported. When choosing a historical archive for a report, it is recommended to give preference to an archive with a data writing period that matches or is close to the step of the report sections. This will avoid fetching unnecessary data.

#### Report List

The `PlgElasticReport.xml` configuration file contains a list of reports divided into groups, which are displayed on the **Main Menu > Reports** page. Example of file contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<PlgElasticReport>
  <ReportGroup name="Elastic Reports" isPublic="false" objNum="0">
    <ReportItem reportID="1" isPublic="false" objNum="0" config="Reports\ElasticReport1.xml" prefix="MyRep" cnlNums="">My report</ReportItem>
  </ReportGroup>
</PlgElasticReport>
```



The `ReportGroup` element attributes:  `name` - the display name of the report group;  `isPublic` - a value indicating whether the group is public, that is, available to all users;  `objNum` - the number of the object to which reports of the group belong. Restricts the group visibility according to a user's access rights to the object.

The `ReportItem` element attributes:  `reportID` - the report identifier, unique within the configuration file;  `isPublic` - a value indicating whether the report is public, that is, available to all users;  `objNum` - the number of the object to the report belong. Restricts the report visibility according to a user's access rights to the object;  `config` - the path of the report form configuration file relative to the views directory;  `prefix` - the file name prefix used when downloading the report;  `cnlNums` - the predefined channel numbers for which the report is generated.

#### Styling

You can customize your own report styles, including fonts, colors, cell sizes, etc. For each report format, styles are configured separately.

To load custom styles, in the `OutputOptions` section of the report configuration, set the `StyleSheet` parameter to `Custom` . It is possible to create multiple custom style files with different suffixes. The `StyleSheet` parameter contains the suffix of the stylesheet file to load.

##### PDF Styles

The `PdfStyleDefault.xml` and `PdfStyleCustom.xml` files specify the formatting of reports in PDF format. These files are located in the web application directory `ScadaWeb\wwwroot\plugins\ElasticReport\templates` . The `PdfStyleDefault.xml` file contains the default styles and should remain unchanged. Custom styles are added to the `PdfStyleCustom.xml` file. When creating custom styles, you can inherit new styles from existing ones or override existing styles.

##### Excel Styles

Similarly, the `ExcelStyleDefault.xml` and `ExcelStyleCustom.xml` files, located in the same directory, specify the formatting of reports in Excel format. The `ExcelStyleDefault.xml` file contains default styles and should remain unchanged. Custom styles are added to the `ExcelStyleCustom.xml` file. Please note that PDF and Excel style file formats are different.

##### HTML Styles

The `html-style-default.scss` and `html-style-custom.css` files define the display of reports in HTML format. The files are located in the `ScadaWeb\wwwroot\plugins\ElasticReport\css` directory. Custom styles are added to the `html-style-custom.css` file using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules.

#### Fonts

##### Fonts in PDF Format

When generating reports in PDF format, the Arial font is used by default. If the required font is not available in the operating system, it is replaced with the built-in Segoe WP font. To change the report font, edit the styles file.

The font search is performed using the following algorithm:

1. The search directory is selected. On Windows, the search is performed in the `C:\Windows\Fonts` directory, on Linux in the `/usr/share/fonts/truetype directory`
2. Based on the font name (FontFamily), the required font file names are determined. 
                Regular font: FontFamily.ttf, FontFamily-Regular.ttf
                Bold font: FontFamilyb.ttf, FontFamilybd.ttf, FontFamily-Bold.ttf
                Italic font: FontFamilyi.ttf, FontFamily-Italic.ttf, FontFamily-Oblique.ttf
                Bold italic font: FontFamilybi.ttf, FontFamily-BoldItalic.ttf, FontFamily-BoldOblique.ttf
            
3. Fallback font file names (candidates) are determined. For bold or italic fonts, regular font files are used as candidates. There are no fallback options for a regular font.
4. If a desired or fallback font is found in the search directory, the font file is loaded and provided for report generation. The search is not case sensitive.

The default fonts usually do not contain characters for languages such as Chinese and Korean. To generate reports in such languages, it is recommended to install the [Arial Unicode MS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/arial-unicode-ms) font. On Windows, the font installation is required for all users so that the font file is placed in the `C:\Windows\Fonts` directory.

![](plg-elastic-report/install-font-en.png)

##### Fonts in Excel Format

In generated reports in Excel format, only the font name is specified; the font itself is not included in the report file. The default font is Arial. When a file is opened in Microsoft Excel or Libre Office Calc, the application loads the font from the system. If the font is missing, automatic replacement is used. You can change the font using the styles file.

#### Generating Report

The list of reports is displayed on the **Main Menu > Reports** page according to the `PlgElasticReport.xml` configuration file. By clicking on a report item, a user navigates to the report parameters page. The set of fields in that form depends on the report settings. After entering the report parameters, click the **Download Report** button to start generating and downloading the report.

Report generation can be started using a direct link. In this case, a user must be logged in. Link examples are shown below. Please note that the sets of request parameters for `PrintReport1` and `PrintReport2` addresses are different.

Example 1:  `http://localhost:10008/ElasticReport/Print/PrintReport1?reportID=1&startTime=2024-05-28&endTime=2024-05-29&archive=Hour&format=Html`

Example 2:  `http://localhost:10008/ElasticReport/Print/PrintReport2?reportID=1&offset=0&period=1&unit=Day&archive=Hour&format=Html`

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reportID | Integer | Report ID from the `PlgElasticReport.xml` file |
| startTime | Date and time in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM format | Report start date and time |
| endTime | Date and time | Report end date and time |
| offset | Integer | Offset of the report start date relative to the current date. Can be positive or negative |
| period | Integer | Duration of the reporting period |
| unit | Day | Month | Unit for offset and period |
| archive | String | Archive code from which the report data is taken |
| format | Pdf | Xlsx | Html | Output format |

## Map Plugin

### Overview

Map Plugin displays the status and parameters of stationary and moving objects on interactive OpenStreetMap maps. The plugin provides visual control of geographically distributed systems and transport. By clicking, a user is taken to a page with detailed information on the object of interest. Download the plugin using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/PlgMap) . The appearance of Map Plugin is shown in the following figure.

![](plg-map-files/map-example-en.png)

### Installation

Map Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . During installation, complete the following additional step: copy the `PlgMap.xml` file from the plugin distribution into your project. The file should be displayed in the project explorer under the **Webstation > Configuration Files** node.

### Configuring

#### Plugin Settings

General plugin settings that affect the display of all maps are located in the `PlgMap.xml` file.

The `GeneralOptions` section contains general plugin options:  `PopupOnClick` - whether to show the coordinates of the point a user clicked on.

The `TileLayers` section contains tile layer settings. Depending on the tile provider, each `TileLayer` has its own set of options. A user can switch tile layers on the map.

The `MarkerIcons` section defines the marker icons that are available on maps. There are two types of marker icons:

1. Icons of the `Classic` type icons are based on an image file. The file name has a suffix corresponding to the object status: `undefined` , `normal` , `error` , and `unbound` (the status is not bound to a channel). The icon files are located in the `SCADA\ScadaWeb\wwwroot\plugins\Map\images` directory.
2. Icons of the `Awesome` type use the popular graphic font called [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search) .

#### Creating Map

Each map is saved in a separate XML file with the `map` extension. The map example, `MapExample.map` , is included in the plugin installation package. Map files should be located in the views directory or its subdirectory.

So, to create a new map, in the Administrator application, create a new XML file with the `map` extension in the **Views** section of the project, and then specify the path to the created file in the **Views** table.

![](plg-map-files/new-map-file-en.png)

![](plg-map-files/map-view-file-en.png)

![](plg-map-files/map-view-table-en.png)

#### Map File Structure

Consider the structure of the map file using `MapExample.map` as an example. All map XML elements are contained within the root `MapView` element.

The `InitialView` element contains the initial coordinates and scale of the map. The scale is an integer between 0 and 18.

```xml
<InitialView>
  <Lat>48.8430</Lat>
  <Lon>2.3275</Lon>
  <Zoom>13</Zoom>
</InitialView>
```



Next come the `LayerGroup` elements, each of which contains a group of map objects. A user can show and hide the group via the web interface.

The `Options` element inside a `LayerGroup` specifies the group's options.

```xml
<Options>
  <Name>Main</Name>
  <DefaultIcon>Site</DefaultIcon>
  <Visible>true</Visible>
  <ShowTooltips>true</ShowTooltips>
</Options>
```



`Name` - group name;  `DefaultIcon` - default marker icon;  `Visible` - visibility of group objects;  `ShowTooltips` - whether to display tooltips for objects.

Let's look at an example of a stationary object, the `Location` element:

```xml
<Location>
  <Name>Eiffel Tower</Name>
  <Descr>Avenue Anatole France, Paris, France</Descr>
  <Icon></Icon>
  <Lat>48.858222</Lat>
  <Lon>2.2945</Lon>
  <StatusCnlNum>0</StatusCnlNum>
  <DataItems>
    <DataItem cnlNum="101" />
    <DataItem cnlNum="104">My text</DataItem>
  </DataItems>
  <Links>
    <Link viewID="2" />
    <Link viewID="2">My link</Link>
  </Links>
</Location>
```



`Name` - object name;  `Descr` - object description;  `Icon` - marker icon. If not specified, the default icon is used;  `Lat` and `Lon` - latitude and longitude of the object;  `StatusCnlNum` - the number of the input channel that shows the object status. Equals 0 if the channel is not specified. Valid channel data: channel status equal to 0 means that the object status is not defined, channel value equal to 0 means the object is normal, channel value equal to 1 means the object is in an error state;  `DataItems` - channels whose values ​​are displayed in the object information popup;  `Links` - links to views that can be accessed from the information popup.

Let's consider an example of a mobile object, the `Vehicle` element:

```xml
<Vehicle>
  <Name>Taxi</Name>
  <Descr>Uber</Descr>
  <Icon>Car</Icon>
  <LatCnlNum>201</LatCnlNum>
  <LonCnlNum>202</LonCnlNum>
  <BearingCnlNum>203</BearingCnlNum>
  <StatusCnlNum>204</StatusCnlNum>
  <DataItems />
  <Links />
</Vehicle>
```



The `Name` , `Descr` , `Icon` , `StatusCnlNum` , `DataItems` and `Links` parameters are similar to a stationary object.  `LatCnlNum` and `LonCnlNum` - channel numbers that determine the latitude and longitude of the object;  `BearingCnlNum` - channel number that determines the rotation of the object. Rotation is measured in degrees. A channel value of 0 corresponds to neutral object rotation. A positive value means clockwise rotation, while a negative value means counterclockwise rotation.

The `Circle` , `Polygon` , `Polyline` and `Rectangle` elements are used to add corresponding geometric shapes to the map.

## Notification Plugin

### Overview

Notification Plugin helps an operator to pay attention to the most important events. The plugin generates notifications based on events according to specified rules and displays them in the notification panel that appears on the right side of the web page. In addition, the plugin turns on an audible alert depending on the notification type. Download the plugin using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/PlgNotification) . The notification panel is shown in the following figure.

![](plg-notification-files/notification-panel-en.png)

The plugin displays only those events that require acknowledgement and have not yet been acknowledged. The filter specified in the plugin configuration is applied to the displayed events. Clicking the **Information** button displays a tooltip related to the notification. If a user acknowledges the event, the corresponding notification is hidden.

### Installation

Notification Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . Follow additional steps during installation:

- Copy the `PlgNotification.xml` file from the plugin distribution into your project. The file should be displayed in the project explorer under the **Webstation > Configuration Files** node.
- In the Webstation application options, in the **Plugin Assignment** section, select the **PlgNotification** plugin as the notification management plugin.

### Configuring

The configuration file `PlgNotification.xml` contains the parameters described in the following table.

| XML Element | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EventFilter** | Event filter section |
| ObjNums | Object numbers |
| DeviceNums | Device numbers |
| Statuses | Status identifiers |
| Severities | Severity values |
| **Tips** | Notification tips section |
| **Tip** | Section that defines one tip |
| TipCondition | Tip condition |
| Link | If the parameter is defined, it specifies a link to go to the tip |
| Html | HTML markup of the tip content |

If the parameter value is a numeric range, it may contain commas and hyphens, for example, *1-5,10* .

Notification Plugin also uses some parameters from the `ScadaWebConfig.xml` file, the general configuration file of the Webstation application:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RefreshRate | Data refresh rate in milliseconds |
| EventArchiveCode | Event archive code on the basis of which notifications are generated |
| EventCount | Number of notifications displayed |
| EventDepth | Number of days to request events |

## Automatic Control Module

### Overview

Automatic Control Module is an additional module for the Server application that sends commands and generates events when certain conditions are met. The module helps to implement various control algorithms and sending notifications without the need for programming, through the user interface. Download the module using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/ModAutoControl) . The following figure shows the form for configuring the module.

![](mod-auto-control-files/auto-control-en.png)

Information about fired triggers, sent commands and events is recorded in the `ModAutoControl.log` module log file, which can be viewed using the Administrator application or any text editor.

### Installation

Automatic Control Module is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#modules) . The module installation sequence is typical.

### Configuring

Setting up the module involves creating triggers that fire when certain conditions are met. Triggers can be of different types, discussed below. When a trigger fires, the module sends commands and generates events that relate to that trigger.

To open the module configuration form, go to the **Server > Modules** page, select the **ModAutoControl** module and click the **Properties** button. The module should be in the list of active modules. The module configuration is saved in the `ModAutoControl.xml` file.

#### Triggers

##### Channel Data Trigger

A channel data trigger is fired when the channel value and status match the conditions specified in the trigger parameters. When started, the module populates a list of channels that satisfy the channel filter. The value and status of the channel, which are specified by the trigger parameters, are checked individually for each channel from that list. If the channel filter is empty, the trigger works for all active channels of the input type.

The trigger has a state that provides the ability to delay and repeat the trigger firing. The trigger state is saved during the module's operation and is loaded when Server starts.

![](mod-auto-control-files/cnl-data-trigger-en.png)

##### Multi-Channel Data Trigger

This type of trigger is used if the condition must take into account the values ​​of more than one channel. If the status of any of the specified channels is not defined, then the condition for that channel is considered not to be met. The trigger state is saved and loaded by the module.

![](mod-auto-control-files/multi-cnl-data-trigger-en.png)

##### Channel Data Change Trigger

A trigger fires when the value or status of the specified channel changes. The corresponding parameter is intended to limit the trigger frequency.

![](mod-auto-control-files/cnl-data-change-trigger-en.png)

##### Event Trigger

An event trigger fires if an event that occurs in the system meets the specified conditions. The trigger also responds to events generated by the module itself. When a trigger fires, new events cannot be generated to avoid an infinite loop.

![](mod-auto-control-files/event-trigger-en.png)

##### Time Trigger

A time trigger can fire every day at specified times, on specific days of the week, days of the month, or on a specific date.

![](mod-auto-control-files/time-trigger-en.png)

##### Command Trigger

A trigger on a command is convenient to use in cases where a series of commands need to be sent based on one command. If a trigger has a data validation condition, the incoming command data is converted to a string using UTF8 encoding and then checked against the condition.

The trigger also responds to commands sent by the module itself. The maximum recursion depth is limited to 10 levels.

![](mod-auto-control-files/command-trigger-en.png)

#### Commands

The figure below shows the parameters of the command that is sent when the trigger fires or normalizes. A command can be sent to a channel or directly to a device. If a command is sent to a channel, the command will be checked for permissions and the output formula will be calculated. If a command is sent to a device, it will be added to the queue for sending to clients as is, without any additional processing. When sending a command to a device, specify the command number or code.

![](mod-auto-control-files/command-config-en.png)

If the **Copy value** checkbox is checked, the value of the command being sent will be copied from the value of the channel or command that fired the trigger, if applicable for the given trigger type. The string data specified in the command parameters may contain variables, which are described below.

#### Events

The following figure shows the parameters of the event that is generated when the trigger fires or normalizes.

![](mod-auto-control-files/event-config-en.png)

If the event severity is set to default (0) in the module configuration, it is assigned by Server based on the channel status. If the severity is non-zero, the event is created with the specified severity.

If the **Acknowledgment required** checkbox is not set, but the **Ack Required** field is set in the configuration database for the channel status, then the event acknowledgement flag is assigned by Server based on the status.

The **Custom text** of the generated event is static without variable support.

#### Variables

The string data of commands that are sent when triggers fire can contain variables. Variables are written in curly braces.

The following variables are supported:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **For triggers of all types** |
| {n} | Current value of channel n, formatted, with dimensions. If n = 0, the trigger channel is used (if applicable) |
| {Now} | Current date and time in the server time zone |
| {NowUtc} | Current UTC date and time |
| {Time} | Trigger fire time in the server time zone |
| {TimeUtc} | Trigger fire time, UTC |
| **For triggers on channel data** |
| {CnlNum} | Channel number |
| {CnlName} | Channel name |
| {ObjNum} | Object number |
| {ObjName} | Object name |
| {DevNum} | Device number |
| {DevName} | Device name |
| {LoLo} | Low low channel limit |
| {Low} | Lower channel limit |
| {High} | Upper channel limit |
| {HiHi} | High high channel limit |
| {CnlVal} | Channel value that caused the trigger to fire |
| {CnlStat} | Channel status that caused the trigger to fire |
| **For event triggers** |
| {EvID} | Event ID |
| {EvTime} | Event time in the server time zone |
| {EvObjNum} | Object number of the event |
| {EvObj} | Object name of the event |
| {EvDevNum} | Device number of the event |
| {EvDev} | Device name of the event |
| {EvCnlNum} | Channel number of the event |
| {EvCnl} | Channel name of the event |
| {EvText} | Display text of the event |
| {EvSev} | Displayed event severity |
| **For command triggers** |
| {CmdVal} | Command value that caused the trigger to fire |
| {CmdDataStr} | Command data as a string |
| {CmdDataHex} | Command data in hexadecimal |

## Database Export Module

### Overview

Database Export Module provides real-time export of data received from devices to popular databases. Supported DBMS are Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL. The module is included in the Rapid SCADA distribution and does not require separate installation. The following figure shows the form for configuring the module.

![](mod-db-export-files/db-export-en.png)

The module supports export to several different databases in parallel. The database to which the export is performed is called the **export target** . Based on the export target options, the module creates an **exporter** , a software object that processes data queues and calls SQL queries.

Information about the module operation is recorded in the `ModDbExport.log` file. Information about the operation of each exporter is written in `ModDbExport_*.log` and `ModDbExport_*.txt` files.

### Configuring

To open the module configuration form, go to the **Server > Modules** page, select the **ModDbExport** module and click the **Properties** button. The module should be in the list of active modules. The module configuration is saved in the `ModDbExport.xml` file.

Add a new export target to the module configuration using the  button, selecting the DBMS from the drop-down list. Next, let's look at the pages containing various groups of export target settings. The screenshots below show the default parameter values.

![](mod-db-export-files/general-options-en.png)

Specify the **Command code** if users plan to manually send commands to export archives. Set the **Status channel number** to monitor the export status via the web interface. A channel of the *Calculated* type should be created in the configuration database. Channel values: *0* - normal, *1* - error. The queue options are set experimentally depending on the amount of exported data and the performance of the database server.

![](mod-db-export-files/connection-options-en.png)

A database into which the export is performed must be previously created and contain tables for storing information. The options for connecting to the database should be clarified with its administrator. If the database server is deployed on a separate computer, the server's firewall settings must be configured to allow incoming connections on the TCP port being used.

![](mod-db-export-files/cur-data-export-en.png)

Current data can be exported *On Receive* by Server from Communicator or *On Timer* . Transferring data when received ensures that all current data received from the polled devices is uploaded to the database. Transferring data by timer reduces the database size and saves network traffic.

![](mod-db-export-files/hist-data-export-en.png)

Historical data export refers to data that is transferred with a timestamp, such as:

- Archives that are downloaded by Communicator from metering devices and transferred to Server.
- Data received from [Rapid Gate Module](mod-rapid-gate.html) installed on a remote server when replicating archives.

The **Delay before export** option helps to avoid multiple exports of calculated data if several data slices with the same timestamp are received one after another. The **Bit of historical archive** is used to retrieve data from the calculated channels.

![](mod-db-export-files/arc-replication-en.png)

Archive replication ensures that the information in the Rapid SCADA archive and in the database is identical. If archive replication is enabled and the **Automatically export archives** checkbox is checked, historical data and events received by the Server service from clients are not added to the export queue to avoid duplication. The replication state is saved while the module is running and is loaded when the Server service is restarted.

![](mod-db-export-files/query-options-en.png)

The figure above shows the options of the SQL query that is called by the exporter when Server receives the corresponding data or when replicating the archive. The [link](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaServer/OpenModules/ModDbExport.Logic/Scripts) contains scripts for creating a database model and sample queries. SQL queries can contain parameters, which are specified with the `@` prefix. To view a list of available parameters depending on the request data kind, click the  button.

If the **Single query** checkbox is unchecked, the SQL query will be called for each channel whose data is processed. The request parameters for exporting the channel value and status are `@val` and `@stat` .

If the **Single query** checkbox is checked, the SQL query will be called once only for those channels whose numbers are explicitly specified in the query filter. In this case, the names of the channel value and status parameters contain the channel number, for example, `@val101` and `@stat101` .

Queries that have the **Single query** checkbox checked are ignored:

1. If current data is exported on receive.
2. When exporting historical data received from clients.

### Commands

Database Export Module supports receiving commands. To send commands to the module, create output type channels in the configuration database. The **Tag code** of the channel must match the **Command code** specified in the general export target options. A command can be sent via the Webstation application web interface or using another client interacting with the Server application.

When a valid command is received, a task is created and added to the exporter task queue. The maximum length of a task queue is 10. If the queue is full, new commands will be ignored.

Example of archive export command:

```
cmd=ExportArchive
startDT=2025-12-31 10:00:00
endDT=2025-12-31 11:00:00
```



Clear the exporter task queue:

```
cmd=ClearTaskQueue
```



The command arguments specify UTC time.

## Rapid Gate Module

### Overview

Rapid Gate Module is designed to synchronize data between Rapid SCADA instances. Download the module using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/ModRapidGate) . The following figure shows the form for configuring the module.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/rapid-gate-en.png)

The module is used to implement the following functions:

1. Transferring data from a downstream Rapid SCADA server to an upstream server in distributed automation systems.
2. Synchronization of data between the primary and backup Rapid SCADA server.

The main function of the module is the transfer of current data, historical data, events and commands from the server on which the module is running to the Rapid SCADA server specified in the settings. The module supports any number of independent gateways for exchanging information with multiple Rapid SCADA servers. The data to be transmitted is added to the queue by the module. This approach ensures reliable operation even with an unstable network connection.

Information about the module operation is recorded in the `ModRapidGate.log` file. Information about the operation of each gateway is written in `ModRapidGate_*.log` and `ModRapidGate_*.txt` files.

### Installation

Rapid Gate Module is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#modules) . No additional actions are required during installation.

### Configuring

To open the module configuration form, go to the **Server > Modules** page, select the **ModRapidGate** module and click the **Properties** button. The module should be in the list of active modules. The module configuration is saved in the `ModRapidGate.xml` file.

Add a new gateway to the module configuration using the  button. Next, let's look at the pages containing various groups of gateway settings. The screenshots below show the default parameter values.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/general-options-en.png)

Specify the **Command code** if users plan to manually send commands to synchronize archives. Specify archive masks if the gateway should transfer data to specific archives. If the archive masks are equal to *-1* , the gateway transfers data to the default archives defined in the configuration database. The queue options are set experimentally depending on the expected time of loss of connection with the remote server.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/connection-options-en.png)

Specify the options for connecting to the remote server. In the firewall settings of the remote server, allow incoming connections on the TCP port being used (10000). It is recommended to create a separate *RapidGate* user with the *Application* role in the configuration database for use by the module. Copy the **Secret key** from the remote server listener options.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/mapping-options-en.png)

If different projects are running on the local and remote servers and have different identifiers in the configuration database tables, fill in the ID mapping options. If the IDs are the same, leave the mapping options blank.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/cur-data-transfer-en.png)

Current data can be transferred by the gateway to the remote server *On Receive* by the local Server from Communicator or *On Timer* . Transferring data when received ensures that new data is displayed on the remote server as quickly as possible. Timer-based data transfer saves network traffic.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/hist-data-transfer-en.png)

Transfer of historical data refers to data transferred with a timestamp, for example, archives that are downloaded by Communicator from metering devices and transferred to Server.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/event-transfer-en.png)

When transferring events and acknowledgements, it is theoretically possible that the acknowledgement will be transmitted before the event. In this case, the event on the remote server will remain unacknowledged. It is important to ensure time synchronization between the local and remote servers, otherwise the latest sent events may not be displayed by the Webstation application on the remote server.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/in-cmd-transfer-en.png)

The gateway requests commands from the remote server at a frequency specified in the settings. To reduce network traffic, increase the polling rate value.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/out-cmd-transfer-en.png)

When transferring outcoming commands, commands intended for an application are not sent. On the remote server, the output formula of the channel to which the command relates is applied to the command value.

![](mod-rapid-gate-files/arc-replication-en.png)

Archive replication ensures that archives on the local and remote servers are identical. Replication can be performed from a local server to a remote one and vice versa. The direction of data transfer is determined automatically based on data availability. The data availability channel is intended to unambiguously determine the presence of data on the local server. If the channel is not specified, the gateway checks for any data in the archive for the time period corresponding to the replication step. The replication state is saved while the module is running and is loaded when the Server service is restarted.

### Commands

Rapid Gate Module supports receiving commands. To send commands to the module, create output type channels in the configuration database. The **Tag code** of the channel must match the **Command code** specified in the general gateway options. A command can be sent via the Webstation application web interface or using another client interacting with the Server application.

When a valid command is received, a task is created and added to the gateway task queue. The maximum length of a task queue is 10. If the queue is full, new commands will be ignored.

An example of a command that transfers data from the local server to the remote server:

```
cmd=UploadArchive
startDT=2025-12-31 10:00:00
endDT=2025-12-31 11:00:00
```



Download an archive from the remote server to the local server:

```
cmd=DownloadArchive
startDT=2025-12-31 10:00:00
endDT=2025-12-31 11:00:00
```



Synchronize (upload and download) archives:

```
cmd=SyncArchive
startDT=2025-12-31 10:00:00
endDT=2025-12-31 11:00:00
```



Clear the gateway task queue:

```
cmd=ClearTaskQueue
```



The command arguments specify UTC time.

## Database Import Driver

### Overview

Database Import Driver is designed to read current data from a third-party database, as well as to write to a third-party database using commands. Supported DBMS are Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL. The driver is included in the Rapid SCADA distribution and does not require separate installation.

### Configuring

Create a new communication line and a device of the *DB Import* type using the wizards called up by the  and  buttons. The communication line is responsible for connecting to one database. The communication channel type of the line is *Undefined* . The following figure shows a communication line node in the project explorer.

![](drv-db-import-files/line-node-en.png)

Open the properties of the created device. The device settings specify receiving tag values ​​and sending commands via SQL queries.

![](drv-db-import-files/connection-options-en.png)

It is assumed that the database that serves as the source of information for the driver already exists and contains the necessary tables. Contact the database administrator for information about database connection options.

The figures below show the query parameters for getting device tag values.

![](drv-db-import-files/query1-params-en.png)

![](drv-db-import-files/query2-params-en.png)

In the **Tags** field, enter the device tag codes. Each line contains the code of one tag. The **SQL** field contains the query text. If the **Single row result** check box is checked (Query 1), the query should return a single row, each field of which contains a tag value. If the checkbox is unchecked (Query 2), the query should return a set of rows, each containing the tag code and value. In the second case, the query result must contain the `code` and `val` columns.

![](drv-db-import-files/command-params-en.png)

Due to command support, the driver can write information to the database by a command sent by an operator or automatically. The **Command code** must match the tag code of the channel through which the command is sent. In the SQL query text, the value and data of the command are available through the `@cmdVal` and `@cmdData` parameters.

Once the device properties are configured, create channels in the configuration database using the wizard called up by the  button.

If the configuration is correct, the device data page will display the obtained values.

![](drv-db-import-files/device-data-en.png)

### SQL Scripts

Example scripts for PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS drv_db_import
    AUTHORIZATION postgres;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drv_db_import.table1
(
    id integer NOT NULL,
    val1 double precision,
    val2 character varying,
    val3 timestamp with time zone,
    CONSTRAINT table1_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drv_db_import.table2
(
    id integer NOT NULL,
    code character varying,
    val double precision,
    CONSTRAINT table2_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drv_db_import.table_out
(
    create_time time with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    cmd_val double precision,
    cmd_data bytea
);

-- Query 1
SELECT val1, val2, val3 FROM drv_db_import.table1 LIMIT 1

-- Query 2
SELECT code, val FROM drv_db_import.table2

-- Command
INSERT INTO drv_db_import.table_out (cmd_val, cmd_data) VALUES (@cmdVal, @cmdData)

```



## Modbus Slave Driver

### Overview

The driver implements the popular [Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) communication protocol and operates as a slave. Using the driver, Communicator waits for incoming requests and commands from a third-party device or application that acts as a master. Supported communication channels are serial port, TCP server and UDP. The driver can operate in either Modbus RTU or Modbus TCP mode. Download the driver using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/KpModbusSlave) .

Modbus Slave Driver features:

1. Receives data from a master device using write commands.
2. Provides data to a master device in response to read commands.
3. Works as a gateway, that is, the driver broadcasts channel values ​​received from other devices.

### Installation

Modbus Slave Driver is installed in accordance with the [general sequence of installing drivers](../installation/install-modules.html#drivers) .

### Configuring

Create a new communication line using the wizard, which is called by the  button. Select the appropriate communication channel type and configure its properties. The following figure shows an example of the TCP server communication channel options.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/tcp-server-channel-en.png)

In the custom communication line options section, add the *TransMode* parameter, which is responsible for the data transfer mode. It can take *RTU* and *TCP* values.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/custom-line-options-en.png)

Using the wizard called by the  button, add one or more *Modbus Slave* type devices to the communication line. The numeric address of the device is important, it is the slave device ID according to the Modbus protocol specification. As an example, three devices operating in different modes were added, which are discussed below. The following figure shows a communication line node in the project explorer.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/slave-line-node-en.png)

The *Independent device* mode is used if Communicator should receive data from a controller that is the master. To transmit information to Communicator, the controller writes data using Modbus functions `0x05` and `0x06` . In addition, the controller can read previously written device tags from Communicator. Reading is performed using Modbus functions `0x01` , `0x02` , `0x03` and `0x04` . A device tag can be written either by the master controller or by a control command sent by an operator.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/independent-device-en.png)

The **Undefined value** option specifies the value that is returned to the master if the requested register data is undefined. It applies to numeric registers and has no effect on flags. If a **Data validity period** is set, tag values ​​will be reset to undefined if no new data is received from the controller for the specified period of time.

The **Device template** defines the structure and addresses of the Modbus registers. The template format used by Modbus Slave Driver (DrvModbusSlave) is identical to the device template format used by Modbus Master Driver (DrvModbus).

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/modbus-template-en.png)

If the independent device mode is selected, after completing the device properties setup, create channels in the configuration database using the wizard called up by the  button. If another device mode is selected, creating channels is not required.

The **Device gateway** mode is used to provide the current channel data of the selected device to a third-party system.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/device-gateway-en.png)

The channels of the data source device and tags of the gateway device are linked based on a comparison of the channel tag codes and the tag codes specified in the gateway template. If the data source device is polled via the Modbus protocol, the same device template can be used to operate the gateway.

If the master executes a write command to the gateway device tag, Communicator sends the corresponding command to Server on the channel associated with the tag. That command can then be passed to a physical device, whose data is transmitted by the gateway.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/channel-gateway-en.png)

The driver operation in the *Channel gateway* mode is similar to the operation in the device gateway mode. The difference is that the channel gateway options explicitly specify the channel numbers whose data is being broadcast. The channel gateway options are shown in the following figure.

![](drv-modbus-slave-files/channel-gateway-options-en.png)

For each selected channel, specify the starting Modbus register **Address** and choose the **Data type** . The **Ratio** is used to transmit a real value of the channel as an integer with a certain number of decimal digits. The **Read only** parameter determines whether the gateway responds to an element write command received from the master.

## Telegram Driver

### Overview

Telegram Driver is designed to send notifications using the popular Telegram messenger. The advantages of using Telegram is quickness of receiving notifications, no fee for the service and easy management of notification groups. Download the driver using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/KpTelegram) .

### Installation

Telegram Driver is installed in accordance with the [general sequence of installing drivers](../installation/install-modules.html#drivers) .

### Configuring

#### Creating Bot

In order for the driver to interact with the Telegram messenger, it is necessary to create a Telegram bot.

1. Install the application and register [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) .
2. Add the bot named [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) to the contact list. 
                
            
3. In the dialog with BotFather, run the command `/newbot` and follow the instructions from BotFather to create a new bot. Once the bot is created, copy the bot token. 
                
            

**Important!** Keep the bot token secret.

#### Driver Settings

Telegram driver setup sequence:

1. Create a separate communication line containing a single device of the *Telegram* type. Use the wizards that are called using the  and  buttons.
2. Open the device properties, enter the bot token obtained earlier and click the **Save** button. 
                
            
3. Upload the project for execution by the  button.
4. Open the **Communicator > Drivers page** , select the **DrvTelegram** driver and register the driver.
5. Re-upload the project for execution.

After completing the described actions, use the communication line log to check that requests to the Telegram server are sent successfully and that responses are received.

![](drv-telegram-files/line-log-en.png)

#### Managing Subscriptions

To receive messages sent by the Telegram driver, create a chat in which one of the participants will be your bot. In the Telegram application, create a new group, add the previously created bot and other contacts who will receive messages.

If the settings are correct, your bot will respond to commands sent from the messenger, for example, the `/help` command. Run the `/info` command to get the chat ID and name.

![](drv-telegram-files/telegram-chat-en.png)

Enter the chat ID and name in the device properties form as shown in the figure below. After saving the properties, upload the project for execution again.

![](drv-telegram-files/config-subscriptions-en.png)

### Sending Messages

To send a message to a Telegram group, you need to send a command with the `Notif` code, containing the group name (or identifier) and the message text. An example of sending a command from the Administrator application is shown in the following figure.

![](drv-telegram-files/send-message-en.png)

Automatic sending of notifications when certain conditions are met and events occur is carried out by [Automatic Control Module](mod-auto-control.html) .

# Additional Applications

## Auto Report

### Overview

The Auto Report application is designed to automatically generate various reports according to a schedule, save them to disk and send them by email. Download the application using the [link](https://rapidscada.net/store/Module/en/ScadaAutoReport) . Sending reports by email is provided by the DrvEmail driver, which is included in the Rapid SCADA distribution and does not require separate installation.

The application supports adding new libraries to the list of generated report types. The following report types are supported by default:

- Historical data report.
- Event report.
- Elastic report.

Auto Report works as a service. The application runs tasks to generate reports according to the schedule. Generated reports are saved to disk and, if the corresponding option is enabled, sent by email. Auto Report connects to the Server application to receive commands for generating reports and to send commands for sending reports via email.

### Installation

The sequence of installing the Auto Report application on Windows:

1. Unzip the application distribution package.
2. Copy the contents of the `SCADA` distribution folder to the Rapid SCADA installation directory.
3. Run the `ScadaAutoReport\svc_install.bat` file as administrator to register the service.
4. Create a shortcut on the desktop to the `ScadaAutoReport\ScadaAutoReportConfig.exe` file to launch the Auto Report configurator.
5. Launch the configurator and perform the following actions: 
                Start the Auto Report service by clicking the  button.
                Open the registration form using the  button and register the application.
            

The installation sequence on Linux is as follows:

1. Unzip the application distribution package.
2. Copy the contents of the `SCADA` distribution folder to the `/opt/scada/` directory.
3. Copy the `Daemons/scadareport6.service` file from the distribution to the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.
4. Enable the service by running the command `sudo systemctl enable scadareport6.service`
5. After the first [start](app-auto-report.html#operation) of the service, copy the computer code from the log, get the registration key and register the application.

### Configuring

The application configuration is saved in the `ScadaAutoReportConfig.xml` file, which is located in the `Config` subdirectory of the application. When using Auto Report on Windows, the configuration is performed using the configurator application, which is launched from the `ScadaAutoReportConfig.exe` file. When running on Linux, the configuration file is edited manually using a text editor.

The screenshots below show the options of the Auto Report application, edited in the configurator application.

![](app-auto-report-files/general-options-en.png)

Set the **Culture** option to a non-empty value if the culture used to generate reports should be different from the culture set in the Administrator application for all applications. Specify the **Time zone** if it is different from the server time zone. Leave both options blank to use the default values.

The **CSS path** is used when generating reports in HTML format for those report types that support this format. The **Report directory** is specified if reports should be saved in a directory other than the default report directory. By default, the `Reports` directory, located one level above the Auto Report application directory, is used to save reports.

If the **Pack reports** checkbox is checked, the reports are saved to disk as ZIP archives. The **Retention** option determines how many days to keep reports on disk.

Specify the **Channel number to receive commands** if reports need to be generated not only according to the schedule, but also upon operator command. The **Channel number to send emails** is used when sending reports via email to transmit commands to the driver.

![](app-auto-report-files/connection-options-en.png)

The **Server Connection** tab contains the options for connecting to the Server application. The specified user must exist in the configuration database. The **Secret key** should be copied from the Server settings.

The **DB Connection** tab is used to set parameters for connecting to a database that contains the information needed to generate reports. For the report types available by default, a database connection is not required.

![](app-auto-report-files/elastic-report-type-en.png)

Information about report types in the configurator is available for viewing only. To edit report types through the configuration file, please consult the developers.

![](app-auto-report-files/task-options-en.png)

To add a new task, click the  button on the configurator toolbar. The task includes up to several reports and is executed on schedule or on command. The task name is used in the report file name, so it can only contain characters that are allowed in file names. The **Start date** option defines the beginning of the period of the generated report relative to the current date. The **Period** option specifies the duration of the report period.

![](app-auto-report-files/schedule-options-en.png)

The task for generating a report can be automatically launched *Every Day* , on certain *Days of Week* or *Days of Month* . The **Time** option specifies the time of day at which the task runs.

![](app-auto-report-files/mail-options-en.png)

If the **Enabled** checkbox is checked in the mail options, then the generated reports, in addition to being saved to disk, are also sent by email using the DrvEmail driver. The **To** field specifies the name of a contact from the driver's address book, the name of a contact group, or an email address.

![](app-auto-report-files/report-config-en.png)

To add a new report to the task, click the  button. Uncheck the **Active** checkbox to exclude the generation of the report when the task is running. The **Prefix** is ​​used in the report file name. The formats available for selection (PDF, XML 2003, XLSX, HTML) depend on the report type. Specify the **Archive code** if the report uses data from the archive that is written by the Server application. The **Custom arguments** are specific to the selected report type.

To use the Auto Report application, make the following settings in the project using the Administrator application:

1. Add a new user, which is specified in the server connection options.
2. Create a communication line, device and channels for email operation, if used.
3. Create a channel for sending commands to generate reports by an operator, if required.

The figures below show examples of setting up the configuration database of the project.

![](app-auto-report-files/devices-table-en.png)

![](app-auto-report-files/command-channel-en.png)

![](app-auto-report-files/mail-channel-en.png)

### Operation

On Windows, the Auto Report service is started, restarted, and stopped using the  ,  , and  buttons located on the configurator toolbar.

On Linux, to start, restart, and stop the service, use the commands:

```
sudo systemctl start scadareport6
sudo systemctl restart scadareport6
sudo systemctl stop scadareport6
```



If the application configuration has changed, restart the Auto Report service for the changes to take effect. Monitor the application's operation using the `ScadaAutoReport.log` file.

When the service is running, tasks are executed according to the specified schedule. To manually start a task, send a command to the channel specified in the general application options. The command value corresponds to the ID of the task to be launched.

Installation of Rapid SCADA Enterprise includes installation of the basic Rapid SCADA Standard distribution and subsequent installation of additional software modules. Installation packages of the enterprise modules are available upon request.

## Audit Log Plugin

### Overview

Audit Log Plugin records the actions of Webstation application users in a PostgreSQL database. The following types of actions are recorded:

- Login.
- Logout.
- Open view.
- Open chart.
- Generate report.
- Send command.

Users with the *Administrator* role have access to generate audit log reports. To generate a report, navigate to **Main Menu > Reports > Audit Log** . An example report is shown in the following figure.

![](plg-audit-files/audit-report-en.png)

Reports are generated in XLSX format and can be opened using Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

### Installation

Audit Log Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . To generate a report, the plugin uses the libraries included in Elastic Report Plugin, so Elastic Report Plugin must also be installed and activated.

The plugin uses a PostgreSQL database, which must be created in advance. The `plg_audit` schema and `audit_log` table are created by the plugin automatically upon startup. The database connection options are specified in the `ScadaInstanceConfig.xml` file, which is located in the `Config` subdirectory of the Rapid SCADA installation directory.

The default database connection options are as follows:  Database name: *rapid_scada*  Username: *postgres*  Password: *postgres*

The password specified in the `ScadaInstanceConfig.xml` file is encrypted using the Administrator application. Password encryption is available in the **Tools > Project Tools > Encrypt Password** menu.

### Configuring

In general, Audit Log Plugin does not require any configuration. If the retention period for user actions needs to be changed, in the `ScadaWebConfig.xml` file, find the `Audit` option group and edit the `Retension` option. This option is measured in days.

## Guard Plugin

### Overview

Guard Plugin constantly monitors all user requests to the Webstation application, detects attempts to brute force attack the web application, and blocks the intruder's requests. When security events occur, they are recorded in the event archive.

Information about the plugin operation is available to users with the *Administrator* role. The following figures show the web interface of the plugin.

![](plg-guard-files/guard-general-en.png)

![](plg-guard-files/guard-users-en.png)

Activity monitoring is performed by users, IP addresses and web sessions. Blocking of violators is carried out by username, by IP address or globally for the web application. In case of a global block, users who are already logged in continue to work.

### Installation

Guard Plugin is installed according to the [instructions](../installation/install-modules.html#plugins) . During installation, complete the following additional step: copy the `PlgGuard.xml` file from the plugin distribution into your project. The file should be displayed in the project explorer under the **Webstation > Configuration Files** node.

### Configuring

Guard Plugin is configured by editing the `PlgGuard.xml` file in the Administrator application. The configuration file contains the parameters described in the following table.

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GeneralOptions** |  | Section of general options |
| UserFailsPerMinute | 10 | Maximum number of failed login attempts allowed per minute for a specific user |
| TotalFailsPerMinute | 100 | Maximum number of failed login attempts allowed per minute for all users |
| BlockingDuration | 1 | Login blocking duration, minutes |
| CacheExpiration | 30 | Cache expiration period for violation data, minutes |
| **EventOptions** |  | Security event recording options |
| ArchiveCode | Events | Archive code for recording events. If not specified, the default event archive is used |
| CnlNum | 0 | Channel number to which generated events belong |

# Developers

## Development Basics

Rapid SCADA is an [open source](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6) project. Therefore, engineers and programmers can join the Rapid SCADA community to develop software that communicates with or integrates with Rapid SCADA. According to practice, an engineer with basic programming knowledge can begin to develop modules for Rapid SCADA, improving his skills bit by bit.

### Module Development

The term **module** refers to a software module that includes a DLL library and a set of additional files, which is built into one of the Rapid SCADA applications, expanding its functionality. Main module types:

- **Logic module** is a library that operates as part of the Server service, which adds data processing logic and mathematical calculations.
- **Communication driver** is a library managed by Communicator, which implements an industrial communication protocol. For example, Modbus, OPC or MQTT.
- **Web plugin** consists of a set of DLLs and scripts that are built into the Webstation application, expanding the capabilities of the Rapid SCADA web interface.
- **Extension** of the Administrator application adds new features to the application's user interface.

For development, use the free [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) environments. The primary development language is C#.

### Integration

Rapid SCADA provides a wide range of integration methods:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | Rapid SCADA has built-in mechanisms for reading and writing real-time data into various popular DBMSs. Import and export can be flexibly configured in accordance with the existing data model. |
| Industrial protocols | SCADA systems made by different manufacturers can exchange data with each other using protocols such as Modbus, OPC or MQTT. One system is a data source, and the other is a data consumer. |
| Application protocol | Rapid SCADA supports its own application protocol, implemented on top of TCP, which is used to exchange data between the Server application and client applications. The protocol is documented, and a .NET client library is available. The application protocol can be used by a third party client to read data from SCADA archives and send commands. |
| Web API | The Webstation application provides access to the Web API, which can be used from both client and server code. An example of using the Web API is available [here](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaWeb/OpenPlugins/PlgMain/wwwroot/custom) . |
| Direct reading of archives | Rapid SCADA supports various types of archives based on files, relational DBMSs and time series databases. Integration can be carried out by directly reading data from the archive by the relevant clients. |

## Logic Module Development

Logic modules have the following features:

- Receive current, historical data and events at the fastest possible speed for processing.
- Record data and events in archives.
- Control commands coming to Server.
- Send commands.

Let's look at the development of the logical part and user interface of a simple module, which will be named *ModAbc* . To develop a complex module, learn and use the [source code](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaServer/OpenModules) of existing modules on GitHub as examples.

### Logic Implementation

Create a new project based on the **Class Library** template. Enter the project name `ModAbc.Logic` , and select the .NET 8.0 framework.

Add dependencies to the `ScadaCommon.dll` , `ScadaCommon.Log.dll` and `ScadaServerCommon.dll` libraries. Binary files of the libraries can be found in the Rapid SCADA installation directory, or compiled from source code.

Double click a project node in **Solution Explorer** to open the project file `ModAbc.Logic.csproj` and edit its properties as shown below.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
  <RootNamespace>Scada.Server.Modules.ModAbc.Logic</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Create a `ModAbcLogic` class and copy the code below. This class implements the logic of the module. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `ModAbc` module code. Explore the source code of the [ModuleLogic](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaServer/ScadaServer/ScadaServerCommon/Modules/ModuleLogic.cs) base class and the [IServerContext](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaServer/ScadaServer/ScadaServerCommon/Modules/IServerContext.cs) interface to learn about the capabilities available when implementing module logic.

```csharp
using Scada.Data.Models;

namespace Scada.Server.Modules.ModAbc.Logic
{
    public class ModAbcLogic : ModuleLogic
    {
        private const int InputChannel = 105;
        private const int OutputChannel = 104;
        private const int UserID = 11;
        private const double Threshold = 10.0;

        private bool high = false;
        private bool low = false;

        public ModAbcLogic(IServerContext serverContext)
            : base(serverContext)
        {
        }

        public override string Code => "ModAbc";

        public override void OnServiceStart()
        {
            Log.WriteAction("Модуль ModAbc запущен");
        }

        public override void OnServiceStop()
        {
            Log.WriteAction("Модуль ModAbc остановлен");
        }

        public override void OnIteration()
        {
            CnlData curData = ServerContext.GetCurrentData(InputChannel);

            if (curData.IsDefined)
            {
                if (curData.Val >= Threshold)
                {
                    if (!high)
                    {
                        ServerContext.SendCommand(new TeleCommand(OutputChannel, 1, UserID));
                        high = true;
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    high = false;
                }

                if (curData.Val < Threshold)
                {
                    if (!low)
                    {
                        ServerContext.SendCommand(new TeleCommand(OutputChannel, 0, UserID));
                        low = true;
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    low = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```



Build the project and copy `ModAbc.Logic.dll` to the Server modules directory `ScadaServer\Mod`

### Interface Implementation

Create a new project based on the **Windows Forms Class Library** template. Enter the project name `ModAbc.View` , and select the .NET 8.0 framework.

Add dependencies to the `ScadaCommon.dll` , `ScadaCommon.Forms.dll` , `ScadaCommon.Log.dll` and `ScadaServerCommon.dll` libraries.

Double click a project node in **Solution Explorer** to open the project file `ModAbc.View.csproj` and edit its properties as shown below.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework>
  <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
  <UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  <RootNamespace>Scada.Server.Modules.ModAbc.View</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Create a `ModAbcView` class and copy the code below. This class implements the user interface of the module. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `ModAbc` module code. In the example, there is actually no user interface for the module, however, a minimal implementation of the interface is required so that the module can be used in the Administrator application. View the source code of the [ModuleView](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaServer/ScadaServer/ScadaServerCommon/Modules/ModuleView.cs) base class to learn about the available features.

```csharp
namespace Scada.Server.Modules.ModAbc.View
{
    public class ModAbcView : ModuleView
    {
        public override string Name => "Модуль ABC";
        public override string Descr => "Простой пример модуля";
    }
}
```



Build the project and copy `ModAbc.View.dll` to the Administrator libraries directory `ScadaAdmin\Lib`

### Run Module

Start the Administrator application or restart it if it is open. Create and open a copy of the `HelloWorld` project, then find the developed module in the **Server > Modules** section. Select the module and make sure its description is displayed correctly. If an error occurs when displaying a module description, there is most likely an inaccuracy in the namespace or class names of the module user interface.

Activate the *ModAbc* module and upload the project for execution. Information about the start and stop of the module should be displayed in the Server log. When the value of channel 105 passes through the threshold 10 specified by the constant, commands 0 or 1 are sent to channel 104.

## Driver Development

Advantages of Rapid SCADA as a platform for driver creation:

- Communicator is responsible for the connection (Serial, TCP, UDP). The developer implements encoding and decoding of data packets.
- A driver can collect current, historical data and events, and send commands.
- The built-in OPC UA server provides data received from the developed driver to third-party OPC clients.
- A ready-made logging system.
- Unified user interface for configuration.

Next, let's look at the development of the logical part and user interface of a simple driver, which will be named *DrvAbc* . To develop a complex driver that implements an industrial protocol, learn and use the source code of existing drivers on GitHub as examples ( [link 1](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaComm/OpenDrivers) , [link 2](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaComm/OpenDrivers2) ).

### Logic Implementation

Create a new project based on the **Class Library** template. Enter the project name `DrvAbc.Logic` , and select the .NET 8.0 framework.

Add dependencies to the `ScadaCommon.dll` , `ScadaCommon.Log.dll` and `ScadaCommCommon.dll` libraries. Binary files of the libraries can be found in the Rapid SCADA installation directory, or compiled from source code.

Double click a project node in **Solution Explorer** to open the project file `DrvAbc.Logic.csproj` and edit its properties as shown below.

  <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
  <RootNamespace>Scada.Comm.Drivers.DrvAbc.Logic</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Create a `DevAbcLogic` class and copy the code below. This class implements the logic for interacting with a device. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `DrvAbc` driver code. Explore the source code of the [DeviceLogic](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaComm/ScadaComm/ScadaCommCommon/Devices/DeviceLogic.cs) base class to learn about the capabilities available when implementing device interaction logic.

```csharp
using Scada.Comm.Config;
using Scada.Comm.Devices;
using Scada.Data.Models;

namespace Scada.Comm.Drivers.DrvAbc.Logic
{
    internal class DevAbcLogic : DeviceLogic
    {
        public DevAbcLogic(ICommContext commContext, ILineContext lineContext, DeviceConfig deviceConfig)
            : base(commContext, lineContext, deviceConfig)
        {
            CanSendCommands = true;
            ConnectionRequired = false;
        }

        public override void Session()
        {
            base.Session();
            Log.WriteLine("DrvAbc driver polling session");
            FinishRequest();
            FinishSession();
        }

        public override void SendCommand(TeleCommand cmd)
        {
            base.SendCommand(cmd);
            Log.WriteLine("Command value = {0}", cmd.CmdVal);
            FinishCommand();
        }
    }
}
```



Create a `DrvAbcLogic` class whose code is shown below. This class implements general, non-device specific driver logic. View the source code of the [DriverLogic](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaComm/ScadaComm/ScadaCommCommon/Drivers/DriverLogic.cs) base class to learn about the available features.

```csharp
using Scada.Comm.Config;
using Scada.Comm.Devices;

namespace Scada.Comm.Drivers.DrvAbc.Logic
{
    public class DrvAbcLogic : DriverLogic
    {
        public DrvAbcLogic(ICommContext commContext)
            : base(commContext)
        {
        }

        public override string Code => "DrvAbc";

        public override DeviceLogic CreateDevice(ILineContext lineContext, DeviceConfig deviceConfig)
        {
            return new DevAbcLogic(CommContext, lineContext, deviceConfig);
        }
    }
}
```



An example of the logical part of the driver is ready. Build the project and copy `DrvAbc.Logic.dll` to the Communicator drivers directory `ScadaComm\Drv`

### Interface Implementation

Create a new project based on the **Windows Forms Class Library** template. Enter the project name `DrvAbc.View` , and select the .NET 8.0 framework.

  <RootNamespace>Scada.Comm.Drivers.DrvAbc.View</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Create a `DevAbcView` class and copy the code below. This class implements the user interface for configuring parameters for interacting with a device. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `DrvAbc` driver code. In the example, there is actually no user interface for the driver, however, a minimal implementation of the interface is required so that the driver can be used in the Administrator application. View the source code of the [DeviceView](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaComm/ScadaComm/ScadaCommCommon/Devices/DeviceView.cs) base class to learn about the available features.

```csharp
using Scada.Comm.Config;
using Scada.Comm.Devices;

namespace Scada.Comm.Drivers.DrvAbc.View
{
    internal class DevAbcView : DeviceView
    {
        public DevAbcView(DriverView parentView, LineConfig lineConfig, DeviceConfig deviceConfig)
            : base(parentView, lineConfig, deviceConfig)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

            : base()
        {
            CanCreateDevice = true;
        }

        public override string Name => "ABC Driver";

        public override string Descr => "Simple driver example";

        public override DeviceView CreateDeviceView(LineConfig lineConfig, DeviceConfig deviceConfig)
        {
            return new DevAbcView(this, lineConfig, deviceConfig);
        }
    }
}
```



An example of the driver part responsible for the user interface is ready. Build the project and copy `DrvAbc.View.dll` to the Administrator libraries directory `ScadaAdmin\Lib`

### Run Driver

Start the Administrator application or restart it if it is open. Create a new project and find the developed driver in the **Communicator > Drivers** section. Select the driver and make sure its description is displayed correctly. If an error occurs when displaying a driver description, there is most likely an inaccuracy in the namespace or class names of the driver user interface.

Create a communication line and add a device using the *DrvAbc* driver to the line. Run the project. In the communication line log you can see information about the operation of the created driver:

```
2024-04-18 13:15:41 Session with the device [3] ABC
DrvAbc driver polling session
```



## Web Plugin Development

Using web plugins you can create:

- New types of views.
- Components for mimic diagrams.
- Reports.
- Web pages for data manipulation.

Let's look at the development of the web interface and interface for configuration a simple plugin, which will be named *PlgAbc* . To develop a complex plugin, learn and use the [source code](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaWeb/OpenPlugins) of existing plugins on GitHub as examples.

### Implementation of Web Interface

Create a new project based on the **Razor Class Library** template. Enter the project name `PlgAbc` , select the .NET 8.0 framework and set the **Support pages and views** checkbox.

Add dependencies to the `ScadaCommon.dll` , `ScadaCommon.Log.dll` and `ScadaWebCommon.dll` libraries. Binary files of the libraries can be found in the Rapid SCADA installation directory, or compiled from source code.

Double click a project node in **Solution Explorer** to open the project file `PlgAbc.csproj` and edit its properties as shown below.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  <AddRazorSupportForMvc>true</AddRazorSupportForMvc>
  <RootNamespace>Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Create a `PluginInfo` class and copy the code below. This class contains information that describes the plugin.

```csharp
namespace Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc
{
    internal class PluginInfo : LibraryInfo
    {
        public override string Code => "PlgAbc";
        public override string Name => "ABC Plugin";
        public override string Descr => "Simple plugin example";
    }
}
```



Create a `PlgAbcLogic` class whose code is shown below. This class implements the basic logic of the plugin. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `PlgAbc` plugin code. Explore the source code of the [PluginLogic](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaWeb/ScadaWeb/ScadaWebCommon/Plugins/PluginLogic.cs) base class to learn about the capabilities available when implementing plugin logic.

```csharp
using Scada.Data.Entities;
using Scada.Web.Services;
using Scada.Web.TreeView;
using Scada.Web.Users;

namespace Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc
{
    public class PlgAbcLogic : PluginLogic
    {
        public PlgAbcLogic(IWebContext webContext)
            : base(webContext)
        {
            Info = new PluginInfo();
        }

        public override List<MenuItem> GetUserMenuItems(User user, UserRights userRights)
        {
            return
            [
                new() { Text = "ABC", Url = "~/Abc/MyPage", SortOrder = MenuItemSortOrder.First }
            ];
        }
    }
}
```



Create an empty Razor Page named `MyPage.cshtml` located in the Abc area. The project structure is shown in the following figure.

![](plugin-development-files/plg-abc.png)

The contents of the `MyPage.cshtml.cs` page model are shown below. To better understand the page source code, it is suggested to view the [service interfaces](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/tree/master/ScadaWeb/ScadaWeb/ScadaWebCommon/Services) available in the web application through dependency injection.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Scada.Web.Services;

namespace Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc.Areas.Abc.Pages
{
    public class MyPageModel(IWebContext webContext, IUserContext userContext) : PageModel
    {
        public int ChannelCount => webContext.ConfigDatabase.CnlTable.ItemCount;
        public string UserName => userContext.UserEntity.Name;
    }
}
```



The page layout file `MyPage.cshtml` has the following contents:

```markup
@page
@model Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc.Areas.Abc.Pages.MyPageModel
@{
    Layout = "_MainLayout";
    ViewBag.Title = "My Page";
}

<h1>My Page</h1>
<p>Number of channels: @Model.ChannelCount</p>
<p>Current user: @Model.UserName</p>
```



An example of the web interface of the plugin is ready. Build the project and copy `PlgAbc.dll` to the root directory of the Webstation application.

### Implementation of Configuration Interface

Create a new project based on the **Class Library** template. Enter the project name `PlgAbc.View` , and select the .NET 8.0 framework.

Add dependencies to the `ScadaCommon.dll` and `ScadaWebCommon.Subset.dll` libraries.

Double click a project node in **Solution Explorer** to open the project file `PlgAbc.View.csproj` and edit its properties as shown below.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
  <RootNamespace>Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc.View</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```



Add the previously created `PluginInfo.cs` file to the project as a reference. Note that the file icon looks like a link.

![](plugin-development-files/plg-abc-view.png)

Create a `PlgAbcView` class and copy the code below. This class implements the user interface of the plugin for the Administrator application. Note that the namespace and class name must contain the `PlgAbc` plugin code. In the example, there is actually no user interface for the plugin, however, a minimal implementation of the interface is required so that the plugin can be used in the Administrator application. View the source code of the [PluginView](https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6/blob/master/ScadaWeb/ScadaWeb/ScadaWebCommon/Plugins/PluginView.cs) base class to learn about the available features.

```csharp
namespace Scada.Web.Plugins.PlgAbc.View
{
    public class PlgAbcView : PluginView
    {
        public PlgAbcView()
        {
            Info = new PluginInfo();
        }
    }
}
```



Build the project and copy `PlgAbc.View.dll` to the Administrator libraries directory `ScadaAdmin\Lib`

### Run Plugin

Start the Administrator application or restart it if it is open. Create and open a copy of the `HelloWorld` project, then find the developed plugin in the **Webstation > Plugins** section. Select the plugin and make sure its description is displayed correctly. If an error occurs when displaying a plugin description, there is most likely an inaccuracy in the namespace or class names of the plugin user interface.

Activate the *PlgAbc* plugin and upload the project for execution. In the Webstation application, navigate to **Main Menu > ABC** to open the web page provided by the developed plugin.

## Module Store

### About Store

Rapid SCADA Module Store helps users find and download additional modules developed by various authors. For developers, Module Store is a platform where an author can present his modules to potential users or buyers.

Module Store is located at [https://rapidscada.net/store/](https://rapidscada.net/store/)

### Module Requirements

Community developers can develop any modules for Rapid SCADA. To publish in the store, a developed module must meet the following requirements:

1. The module web page should contain the contacts of the author and technical support. There is no need to create a dedicated module website. This can be a shared site such as a forum, social network, or GitHub.
2. The module must be documented. It is recommended, in addition to the text manual, to develop a video instruction that is desired by users.
3. If a module duplicates the functionality of paid modules developed by the Rapid SCADA team, then the price of your module should not be lower than the price of a similar existing module.

The final decision to publish a module is made by the moderator.

### Module Naming

Module name should reflect the purpose of the module, and may also contain the full or abbreviated name of the author. Suppose an author named *Lion King* has developed a driver that implements the *MQTT* protocol. Then the appropriate module name would be *Lion MQTT Driver* .

Module file name is related to the module display name. Module file names use prefixes to indicate the type of module. For example:

- Plg ChartPro.dll - Webstation plugin,
- Mod AutoControl.Logic.dll - Server module,
- Drv Telegram.Logic.dll - Communicator driver,
- Ext TableEditor.dll - extension for the Administrator application.

It is recommended to use a file suffix to indicate authorship of a module. Continuing with the example, the driver file might be named *DrvMqttLion* .Logic.dll.

### Add Your Module

To add your module to the store, fill out the [form](https://rapidscada.org/community/add-module/) . Below are guidelines for completing some of the form fields.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Module home URL | Specify a web page that contains general information about the module. Example:  [https://forum.rapidscada.org/?topic=driver-gpio-for-scada-v6-1](https://forum.rapidscada.org/?topic=driver-gpio-for-scada-v6-1) |
| Module documentation URL | Specify a web page that contains instructions for setting up the module. Example:  [https://github.com/JurasskPark/RapidScada_v6/tree/master/OpenDrivers](https://github.com/JurasskPark/RapidScada_v6/tree/master/OpenDrivers) |
| Download URL | Specify a link to a cloud storage where the author can easily upload new versions. Examples:  [https://github.com/Manjey73/OpenDrivers/releases?q=DrvGpiod](https://github.com/Manjey73/OpenDrivers/releases?q=DrvGpiod)  [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18bApJzEzJ_ipM8m89N7YZNH-M8BcYQuE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18bApJzEzJ_ipM8m89N7YZNH-M8BcYQuE) |
